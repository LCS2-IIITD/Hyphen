"I converted the first set of coordinates. It maps to an area in the southern range of the Russian tundra. The other coordinates are clearly similar. The images mostly likely are of archaelogical investigations of older Chukchi settlements. The Chukchi, who are still around, are nomadic tribes of Russia's high north who have been around for probably thousands of years, and their ancestors are the likely ancestors of the majority of Native Americans.","# ::snt I converted the first set of coordinates.
