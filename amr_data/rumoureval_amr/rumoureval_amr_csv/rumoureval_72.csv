"Well, perhaps, but it could equally well be described as 'simplistic and inaccurate'.Turnout varies enormously by social grade, with % turnout from those in grade AB and % turnout from those in DE. AB voters lean Conservative (45% Con, % Lab) and DE voters lean Labour (27% Con, % Lab). Both groups account for roughly % of the population.So it's entirely possible that if you accounted for differential turnout according to both age and social class, you'd get a different result, and find that uniform turnout would have changed the results (ie voters represented a skewed sample of the electorate). To do that meaningfully you'd need (good) polling data dividing the population up by both criteria, though, and I'm not sure such data exists.","# ::snt Well, perhaps, but it could equally well be described as 'simplistic and inaccurate'.Turnout varies enormously by social grade, with % turnout from those in grade AB and % turnout from those in DE.
