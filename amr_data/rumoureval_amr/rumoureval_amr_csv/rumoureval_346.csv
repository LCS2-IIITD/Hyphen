"From wikipedia: ""Though past research showed no correlation between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and food dyes,[15][16] new studies now point to synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents as aggravating ADD and ADHD symptoms, both in those affected by these disorders and in the general population.[17][18] Older studies were inconclusive, quite possibly due to inadequate clinical methods of measuring offending behavior. Parental reports were more accurate indicators of the presence of additives than clinical tests.[19] Several major studies show academic performance increased and disciplinary problems decreased in large non-ADD student populations when artificial ingredients, including artificial colors, were eliminated from school food programs.[20][21]""There is some scientific validity to what she is saying. Maybe she should be giving you the hard stare for automatically assuming she was wrong without doing your research first.","# ::snt From wikipedia: ""Though past research showed no correlation between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and food dyes,[15][16] new studies now point to synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents as aggravating ADD and ADHD symptoms, both in those affected by these disorders and in the general population.[17][18] Older studies were inconclusive, quite possibly due to inadequate clinical methods of measuring offending behavior.
