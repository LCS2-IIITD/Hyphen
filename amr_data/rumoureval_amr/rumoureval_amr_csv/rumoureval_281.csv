"Just about every sentence is wrong, as others will point out, but what puzzles me is what was going on in the author's head? Does the author think ants *should* expend energy scavenging for a sweetener designed to be non-nutritive? If ants are fooled into trying to run their nest off zero-calorie food, they're going to have a bad time, then we would have the same author spreading facebook memes about how ants not avoiding it proves it's toxic.Edit: hollowgram shows [the image was originally a joke]() - can't tell if it whooshed over the author's head.","# ::snt Just about every sentence is wrong, as others will point out, but what puzzles me is what was going on in the author's head?

I find the Snopes ant test fascinating but it brought up a significant question for me: I expected Aspartame would be lower in calories so shouldn't the ants in their test have fared poorly? TIL: Aspartame has cal per teaspoon compared to sugar's cal per teaspoon but since it is so much sweeter less is used and so aspartame products are low calorie.,"# ::snt I find the Snopes ant test fascinating but it brought up a significant question for me: I expected Aspartame would be lower in calories so shouldn't the ants in their test have fared poorly?
