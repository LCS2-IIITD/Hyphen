"Sequencing a tissue a tissue sample would put this to rest. Luckily that's already been done thousands of times in order to identify risk associated genetic markers for cancer. This research is carried out by universities, not the 'oh so evil pharma'. It would be immediately obvious if you found fungal DNA rather than mammalian material. This isn't even including all the chemical stains you could perform to identify whether a sample is a human cells or fungal cells.Maybe we should add radium to his food, as long as he has his sodium bicarbonate he should be fine right?","# ::snt Sequencing a tissue a tissue sample would put this to rest.
