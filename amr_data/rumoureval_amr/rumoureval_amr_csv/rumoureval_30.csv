"Lol natural news.On a serious note, even if the % consensus is ""bunk"" the science is not.Edit: I'm going to expand on this a little more and explain why the science is not bunk:Firstly, we know that CO2 traps heat, it is a greenhouse gas just like methane and water vapour. The way these molecules trap heat is easy: they absorb the radiation, keep it then radiate it out in all directions. Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues.The way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback, which is a way of saying ""something causes itself"". Heating the atmosphere has another effect, heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG, yeah you're seeing where this is going. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more GHG's it can absorb and so on.Now where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2. Yes plants and trees absorb CO2, the issue is that this cycle (aptly named the Carbon Cycle) was in equalibium, the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving. Now it is not equal, the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase.I hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand.(I'm a student in my rd year of environmental science with year being mostly CC so AMA I guess?)","# ::snt Lol natural news.On a serious note, even if the % consensus is ""bunk"" the science is not.Edit: I'm going to expand on this a little more and explain why the science is not bunk:Firstly, we know that CO2 traps heat, it is a greenhouse gas just like methane and water vapour.

"Oh oh, Skeptoid did an episode about this recently! Another important thing to note is that we can tell the difference between carbon sources based on the amount of C14 isotopes they have. Since C14 is made in the atmosphere and likes to decay, things that are alive have proportions of C14 to C12 in line with the atmosphere, with some notable exceptions. Things that are dead lose their C14 as it decays to the more stable C12. Since the stuff we're concerned about is ""fossil fuel"", fuel derived from the remains of long-dead life forms, it has no remaining C14. We can check the proportion of our atmosphere composed of C14 to C12 and tell that the vast majority of added carbon in the CO2 is C12. The only other real source of massive amounts of C12 being pumped into the atmosphere is volcanoes, and we know how much CO2 they're pumping out. It's much less than the increase of CO2 we're experiencing, doesn't explain the increase.","# ::snt Oh oh, Skeptoid did an episode about this recently!

You end up arguing things that really shouldn't matter - it doesn't matter whether , or % of scientists ""endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming"" - and arguing the percentage is a waste of time. If they want to argue against man made climate change they need to provide evidence that the climate isn't changing due to man's actions.Still - here we are.First thing I noticed was that it talks about one survey, when multiple have been conducted showing similar percentages, the wikipedia article you linked talks about Harris Interactive's survey of randomly selected scientists, the paper in Environmental Research Letters that looked at abstracts - I believe there have been others. The site seems to ignore these.The other things that jump out at me are.&gt; the researchers then selected of their sample and declared them experts.""Well no the researchers did not do that, those surveyed did - by publishing papers on climate change - it shouldn't be a surprise that out of scientists only of them were climate scientists... It's a poor way to decide if man made climate change is correct or not - but I don't think the poll claims that it is.&gt; So if I send out an email survey to people, and then I hand-pick the responses I like the best, then can I proclaim those results to be ""settled science"" too? Will Al Gore champion my cause and demand billions in reparations from first world nations on my behalf?No because it doesn't prove anything, nor is that an accurate description of what happened, nor should this (sadly it is) used to describe how correct anthropomorphic climate change is.So sure, if we ignore all other surveys that confirm the statistic - then this alone as a support for anthropomorphic climate change is weak, usefully there are other things supporting man made climate change other than one email poll.
