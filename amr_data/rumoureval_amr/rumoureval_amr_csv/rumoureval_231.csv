Please explain why both can't be true. They are not mutually exclusive positions. Kubrick worked on alien concepts and also considered Carl Sagan's recommendation not to show them.The idea that none of this would have been done if Kubrick followed Sagan's is false. He could still have gone ahead and looked at possible aliens but eventually agreed with Sagan's view.,"# ::snt Please explain why both can't be true. They are not mutually exclusive positions.
