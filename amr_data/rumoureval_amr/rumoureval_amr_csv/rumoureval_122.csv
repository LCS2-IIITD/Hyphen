"That claim is based on the books ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society"", by David Grossman; and ""Men against Fire"", by SLA Marshall.I'll get my bias out here - I think this idea is crap, and the basic reason is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and there is no evidence to support that claim.Marshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that % of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists.In fact, the only record of his interviews at all (besides his books), makes mention of soldiers firing weapons, but nothing whatsoever that could support a hard number of how many men fired or did not fire.There is no evidence of statistical analysis based on his interviews, no records of questions about whether soldiers fired or not, no questions about ammunition consumption. There is no evidence from quartermasters about ammunition consumption, barrel wear, or any other secondary evidence.So this number is one that Marshall may have arrived at honestly, but there is simply no evidence to support it.If you're interested, Robert Engen wrote a very incisive article on the subject in the Canadian Military Journal, and wrote his Masters thesis on the subject.Engen found (and has the evidence to prove) that - for Canadians, at the very least - did not have this problem. Based on primary sources (written post-combat interviews with Canadian officers), he found *exactly the opposite* of what Marshall and Grossman claim.Canadian officers found that their forces fire was very effective, and, if anything, their men fired *too much*!So - there's no evidence to support this claim, and there is primary source evidence that it is BS.If you'd like to read Engen's article in the CMJ or his thesis, here they are: the interest of (a little) balance, Grossman makes a (in my opinion very feeble) defense of his work and Marshall's in the CMJ as well","# ::snt That claim is based on the books ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society"", by David Grossman; and ""Men against Fire"", by SLA Marshall.I'll get my bias out here - I think this idea is crap, and the basic reason is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and there is no evidence to support that claim.Marshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that % of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists.In fact, the only record of his interviews at all (besides his books), makes mention of soldiers firing weapons, but nothing whatsoever that could support a hard number of how many men fired or did not fire.There is no evidence of statistical analysis based on his interviews, no records of questions about whether soldiers fired or not, no questions about ammunition consumption.

":*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman.

It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true. Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?The major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and, in common with the majority of social research, it is impossible to control for the relevant variables:&gt; ""Everyone stop! OK, now I want Smoggins to stand up and lets see if Gruber over there fires at him.""Almost everything in this area is laced with bias. Soldiers don't want to be seen as cowards, commanders want to believe their men are good fighters, very few people understand what battle is actually like, very few psychologists are soldiers, very few soldiers are psychologists and it is very rare to find scholars with relevant military experience who can combine academic rigour in both history and psychology. *On the Psychology of Military Incompetence* by Norman Dixon is a good example: Dixon was a Major in the Royal Engineers and an esteemed psychologist, but the historical section of his book is extremely suspect - especially his treatment of World War One.Against this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research. What is not in any doubt is that western militaries have gone to great lengths since the end of World War Two to develop sophisticated, realistic training environments to prepare soldiers for battle and develop instinctive responses to stimuli: in effect to stop the soldier from thinking.","# ::snt :*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman.

"Don't be ashamed, it's a reasonable point I have overlooked.Typical modern battles are kinetic, soldiers rarely fight at bayonet distance, they often fight at (50 to meters away)[] (even in a stress free environment like a shooting range, it's a bit difficult firing at a target that far away). So even if you're pulling the trigger, it's hard to aim, subconsciously you don't want to kill, so when you fire, you might purposefully... miss slightly.That was my point.
