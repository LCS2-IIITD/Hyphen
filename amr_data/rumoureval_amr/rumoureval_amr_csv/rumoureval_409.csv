"Being homeless doesn't give you a reason to break the law? What? How do you eat when you don't have a job? Panhandling is illegal, people won't give you work...it makes sense that people resort to theft. Doesn't make it right, but a man's gotta eat.I would also disagree with you that some schizophrenics are making a choice to break the law. Some of these people have lost touch with reality.&gt; If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again. That's a really nice thought. Too bad that if you're in prison for life, there's zero chance of that happening. Look, I get the whole ""you keep doing this, we're going to make it worse on you until you stop."" But there's a whoooole lot of room between a year in prison for minor theft and the rest of your life. Sentence someone to five years, ten years. Hell, sentence them to thirty years and that's probably *still* less than life in prison. Thirty years! For stealing three belts! Who's heartless enough to do that to a person? After thirty years your old life would be unrecognizable. It doesn't make sense to punish someone that long because they're not even the same person they were when they committed the crime. Life in prison is *worse* than that.&gt; It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested. It does matter that you agree with that decision, because these laws won't change until most people change their minds about stuff like this. And until then, these people will be *bigger* drains on society because, like we both agreed on, it's not worth $30,000 dollars a year to house and feed someone just because they stole $15 worth of stuff.","# ::snt Being homeless doesn't give you a reason to break the law?
