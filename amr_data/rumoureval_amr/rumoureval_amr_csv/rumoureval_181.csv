"[Actual quote from President Trump]():&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.President Trump [left for the UK on Friday th June]() (UK time), arrived in Scotland [some time later on Friday th June]() - around am - and was [getting ready to open Turnberry]() around am.No matter how you spin it he didn't open Turnberry the day before Brexit.The guy couldn't remember basic facts.-------Other gems from the press conference. The whole ""fake news"" for reporting what he said thing, saying ""We left [the Nato] meeting more unified and wealthier as a group than ever before"" - interesting use of ""wealthy"" there.On meeting with President Putin:&gt; We will talk about a number of things: Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, nuclear proliferation. We are massively modernizing and fixing and buying and its just a devastating technology. It is a very bad policy. We have no choice. We are massively big and they are very big and Ill be talking about nuclear proliferation.On Nato spending:&gt; I say we pay percent of the cost of NATO, which is really there for Europe much more than for us.He can say that, but it isn't true. Based on [a couple]() of [sources]() the US contributes % of Nato's common fund, and about % of Nato military spending.On immigration, after some classic dog-whistle racism:&gt; Its not good for Europe and its not good for our country. We have very bad immigration laws. Were doing incredibly well considering we virtually dont have immigration laws I dont even call them laws, you just walk across the border and then youre tied in a lawsuit for five years.On the UK-US special relationship:&gt; I would give our relationship with the U.K. the highest level of special. Am I allowed to go higher than that? They are very special people, its a very special country and my mother was born in Scotland. As far as advice goes, I gave her a suggestion and I think maybe she found it too brutal. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I can fully understand why she thought it might be tough if they dont get the right deal, she may choose to do what I suggested. Its a disgrace how the EU has taken advantage of the U.S.On Russia invading Ukraine:&gt; President Obama failed very badly with Crimea I wouldnt have done that. He took it over during the Obama administration. Well have to see what happens ... Im not bad at doing things. Lets see what happens. This was an Obama disaster. If I were president, he would not have taken over.On Theresa May:&gt; She will do very well. She is a tough negotiator and a very smart and determined people.On the Russia meeting:&gt; Proliferation, to me, is the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. I used to talk nuclear with my uncle. It is the biggest problem the world has, so if we can do something to reduce them, maybe its a dream, but its a subject I will bring up with him. I was telling the PM that Im not going in with high expectations. We have stupidity going on in the U.S. that makes it hard to do something with Russia. People say he loves Russia - I love the U.S. I love China and I love other countries.","# ::snt [Actual quote from President Trump]():&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.President Trump [left for the UK on Friday th June]() (UK time), arrived in Scotland [some time later on Friday th June]() - around am - and was [getting ready to open Turnberry]() around am.No matter how you spin it he didn't open Turnberry the day before Brexit.The guy couldn't remember basic facts.-------Other gems from the press conference.
