"The old dangers of over charging are no longer present...but if you keep your phone on a charger for days and days on end then the battery has a chance of swelling from not discharging more than a percent or two. This is extremely unlikely though. The only reason you'd need to discharge a battery fully is to reset the metaphorical ""counter"" on the percentage meter so it's more accurate...but it has no real effect on the battery capacity or life itself.","# ::snt The old dangers of over charging are no longer present...but if you keep your phone on a charger for days and days on end then the battery has a chance of swelling from not discharging more than a percent or two.
