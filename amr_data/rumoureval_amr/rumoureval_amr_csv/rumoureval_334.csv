"...yes, that is indeed the current accepted reasoning. Im implying that its for a different, much deeper reason.

Is it that hard to understand? People would wander around looking at brown dirt and grey rocks and one day they saw gold! The first shiny rock! Sweet this is way better than that black rock or the red Rock and look I can even form it into shapes I like easy and it won't break like stupid green rocks or pearl rocks!! This shiny rock is awesome! I'll call it gold!!That same discovery happened all over the world by various tribes of men in the same organic manner except for maybe native Americans who saw no value in it.,"# ::snt Is it that hard to understand?
