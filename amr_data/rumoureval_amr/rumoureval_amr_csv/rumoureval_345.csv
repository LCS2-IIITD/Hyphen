"I can't believe people are missing the two obvious flaws in this analysis. This infographic doesn't show that companies control % of the media. It doesn't provide any basis for the % figure.

They give the numerator (the media giants and the media they create or distribute), but never give the denominator (the total amount of media Americans consume).

I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean. Comcast is not the only provider in NYC or Chicago, and NBCUniversal was not the only cable channel/content producer/network, so in what sense did the merger create a ""monopoly"" in markets? *&gt; ""In , the FCC forbade companies ownership of more than stations.

Many of those companies are now struggling to stay afloat, because radio audiences have cratered due to the rise of things like the iPod, satellite radio and the Internet. But, you argue, maybe radio would be doing better if it was still locally owned instead of owned by big chains. That's a valid hypothesis. Unfortunately, locally owned and operated radio stations are not doing particularly well, either. The entire industry is struggling.
