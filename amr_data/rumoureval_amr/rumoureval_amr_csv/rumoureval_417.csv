We have the co2 records going back millions of years, from measuring trapped air bubbles in stone. We've seen co2 get really high, then get lower as plants sequestered it as hydrocarbons. It's all over the place. So it isn't really relevant to ask what the co2 output of a volcano is, because it never really had enough of an impact historically to really be a relevant factor. I.
