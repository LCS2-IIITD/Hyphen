", the only known affect of non-ionizing radiation is heating. It's not linked to cancer the way ionizing radiation is.Cellphones emit non-ionizing radiation only. In fact, the radiation emitted by a cellphone is generally between cm and cm. Whereas light needs to be at around nm to do damage, or around million times more energetic.They have to be this weak in order to be useful, only visible light and radio waves can punch through the atmosphere. For comparison, visible light ranges from -350nm, and we receive far more of it and radio waves from the sun than from our cellphones.","# ::snt , the only known affect of non-ionizing radiation is heating.

"An initial problem with the article is the use of the blanket term 'radiation'.

Does simply walking into your kitchen immediately turn you into a balloon? What about if you eat a few biscuits a day? A week?A number of different organisations have studied the potential dangers of cellphone emissions, and the results have been indecisive at best.As for the suggestions... well, they're functionally reasonable if one assumes that one's phone is in fact dangerously radioactive, but they render the phone barely usable.

Water is very resistant to many forms of radiation, and this approach is used by all nuclear power plants to control radiation.","# ::snt An initial problem with the article is the use of the blanket term 'radiation'.
