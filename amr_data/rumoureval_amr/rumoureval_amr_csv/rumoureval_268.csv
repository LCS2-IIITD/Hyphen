"You are on the right track.

"Thanks so much for your answer! If you have knowledge of the 'ratio' of the fuel necessary to get to the moon (i.e. get out of the earth's gravity well) vs. the fuel needed to get a much smaller vehicle in and out of the moon-orbit and then back into the earth-orbit that takes it home, that would be very helpful Thanks for giving me further things to google though!","# ::snt Thanks so much for your answer!
