"Actually, he is right, kind of. Though nicotine can have bad side effects in excess (as almost all drugs, including caffeine) and is very addictive (roughly as addictive as morphine) the main health problems associated with smoking concern the build up of carcinogens and various oxidants that cause a myriad of physiological damage that would take me a few hours to type out comprehensively. Nicotine itself is not considered carcinogenic, which is why nicotine therapies (like a patch) are favored over cigarette use. It gives the person the nicotine fix (albeit, less effective than inhaling) without loading down your body with the huge list of added chemicals in cigarettes. Is nicotine good for you? No, its not. It can cause hypertension, birth problems, and a few other minor problems. However, caffeine and ethanol are both ""not good"" for you in most contexts, and its all about weighing out their potential health risks with whatever value we place on their psychoactive effects. It is absolutely true, though, that cigarettes carry with them a lot of baggage that causes many of the health problems associated with smoking, and the only reason people smoke is because of nicotine, so in that sense it is the ""worst"" thing in a cig.Just to add some primary literature to this, here is an excerpt from Uptodate, which is paid access so you cannot see it.&gt;NICOTINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK Smoking is an important and established risk for myocardial infarction and other coronary events, including angina pectoris [11-13]. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex. The main responsible constituents are combustion products, including oxidizing chemicals, acrolein, butadiene, metals (such as cadmium), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulates, and carbon monoxide. Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals, increase lipid peroxidation, and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of LDL, and platelet activation.Nicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events. There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctionAlso, wikipedia has alot of this information.Now, your friend may think an e cig is absolutely safe. This is a dubious claim, since, not only does nicotine have some negative side effects, but the current regulations on e cigs are effectively non-existent. This means their may be some other various chemicals that make them unsafe. They are a fairly new thing so research is insufficient. My personal opinion is that they are definitely more safe than cigarettes, less safe than nothing at all, but a potentially excellent smoking cessation therapy option that could get people to stop smoking.","# ::snt Actually, he is right, kind of.
