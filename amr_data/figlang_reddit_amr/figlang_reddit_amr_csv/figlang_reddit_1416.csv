Let's connect the dots: - mass deportation means illegal immigrants will be arrested and sent to detention centers - those detention centers (which trump wants more of along the border) are most likely going to be private prisons - private prisons use prisoners for work contracts for pennies on the dollar - it takes months for the court proceedings to deport an illegal immigrant expansion of legal slavery?,"# ::snt Let's connect the dots: - mass deportation means illegal immigrants will be arrested and sent to detention centers - those detention centers (which trump wants more of along the border) are most likely going to be private prisons - private prisons use prisoners for work contracts for pennies on the dollar - it takes months for the court proceedings to deport an illegal immigrant expansion of legal slavery?
