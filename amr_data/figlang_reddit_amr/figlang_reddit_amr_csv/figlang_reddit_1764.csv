"The biggest are the lies of omission: They teach nothing about paying taxes or filing taxes or how much you'll pay in taxes (county, city, state, property, sales taxes, others) Nothing about buying a home or mortgages or your credit rating Nothing about how to manage your retirement account Nothing about managing a personal budget, or a family budget, or a household budget Nothing about the variety of financial accounts you'll want or need Nothing about the dangers of revolving credit or debt or interest rates or how to bank Nothing that will teach you personal responsibility of your finances They basically create lemmings for the bankers & IRS to suck dry for their entire lives.","# ::snt The biggest are the lies of omission: They teach nothing about paying taxes or filing taxes or how much you'll pay in taxes (county, city, state, property, sales taxes, others) Nothing about buying a home or mortgages or your credit rating Nothing about how to manage your retirement account Nothing about managing a personal budget, or a family budget, or a household budget Nothing about the variety of financial accounts you'll want or need Nothing about the dangers of revolving credit or debt or interest rates or how to bank Nothing that will teach you personal responsibility of your finances They basically create lemmings for the bankers & IRS to suck dry for their entire lives.
