I love this... - Incursions is cheesed - Massive releases a patch that fixes the cheese (indirectly) and disables weekly rewards - 5 hours later players find another cheese for Incursions - another 5 hours later players find out a cheese on how to get weekly rewards The creativity and determination of this playerbase is absolutely insane,"# ::snt I love this... - Incursions is cheesed - Massive releases a patch that fixes the cheese (indirectly) and disables weekly rewards - 5 hours later players find another cheese for Incursions - another 5 hours later players find out a cheese on how to get weekly rewards The creativity and determination of this playerbase is absolutely insane
