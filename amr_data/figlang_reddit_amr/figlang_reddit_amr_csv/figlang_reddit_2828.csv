"Really Kakashi... You're in Obito's dimension, free to take a cheap shot without Obito realizing what you're able to do... Maybe you could use one of those very few techniques that you've created... Maybe someone else's technique, such as the rasengan... Heck, you could even just pull out a kunai and take a good stab at Obito... And your choice of attack is to punch him?","# ::snt Really Kakashi... You're in Obito's dimension, free to take a cheap shot without Obito realizing what you're able to do...
