I think this I sort of can see happening. Horny kid tries to force himself on some woman? But what's wrong here? It's not that I find the story plausible. That's fine. Its the fucking paper publishing his name before it was proven he did try rape her and she stays anonymous. Why?? First find him guilty before labelling him a rapist. In fact the whole article would have been fine if they just left his name out.,"# ::snt I think this I sort of can see happening. Horny kid tries to force himself on some woman?
