"Yeah, a lot of people dont know how insidious and sneaky it is (and I'm glad they don't, because I wouldn't wish addiction upon anyone). I'm not an opioid addict either, but I am an alcoholic and we get put into the same programs as everyone else, and the majority of treatments I've been through have been with people addicted to opioids. We all tick in mostly the same way, just with different substances. Substance addiction doesnt give a fuck about your color, age, sexuality, or economic class; it is very equal-opportunity about fucking you up.","# ::snt Yeah, a lot of people dont know how insidious and sneaky it is (and I'm glad they don't, because I wouldn't wish addiction upon anyone).
