But the alternatives are ) Don't teach uncomfortable parts of history at all ) Literally ask the Black students to leave the room so that everyone else can discuss the N-word without making them uncomfortable. In my opinion both of those alternatives are much worse, and I can't see a better one. &; It seems to me like saying we aren't going to teach about the Holocaust because Jewish students find it hard to talk about.","# ::snt I'm sure some Black students to feel uncomfortable talking in class about a book where a character uses the N word or talks about lynching people.
