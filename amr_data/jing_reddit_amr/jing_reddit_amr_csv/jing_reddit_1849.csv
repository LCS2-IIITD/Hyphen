"I don't think men are more likely to play a female character, much less due to ""sex appeal."" Games aren't about sex. It's basically the opposite, the more you game the less you will have sex. Female action movies/games are by definition *camp.* Having a male character in an action/fighting game is far more immersive.","# ::snt I don't think men are more likely to play a female character, much less due to ""sex appeal.""
