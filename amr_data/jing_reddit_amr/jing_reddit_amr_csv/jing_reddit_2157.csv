"Bushmaster as a character was halfway decent, but the show wasn't just Bushmaster. It was also scoutmaster Luke Cage, his not so comic relief sidekick, evil headmistress <what's her name>, her silly looking daughter, that goofy guy from Sons Of Anarchy and the rest of the clique. All the gangster stuff was Charmed level bad.","# ::snt Bushmaster as a character was halfway decent, but the show wasn't just Bushmaster.
