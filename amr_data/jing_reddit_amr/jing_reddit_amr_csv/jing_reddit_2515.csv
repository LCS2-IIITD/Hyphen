"Well, in general 'the elite' have a taste for it. There's lots of history in this, but powerful and influential people have been found to be rapists or pedophiles on a grand scale, especially in the eu and the us. Lolita express (tons of incriminating and suspicious emails, written in code, outrageous purchases for things that have been deciphered as boys/girls), pedo island (Clintons, Obama, several aides, etc), harvey weinstein, whats his face from house of cards, etc. They've been known rapists of young girls for decades but everyone in the know played their part and kept silent until it became beneficial to them not to. There's loads more, but that's the general gist of it.","# ::snt Well, in general 'the elite' have a taste for it.
