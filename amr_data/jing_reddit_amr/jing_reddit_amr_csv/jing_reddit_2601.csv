"yeah screw those white men dying in the trenches in absolutely horrific and terrifying ways, they don't know real suffering. real suffering is being a white woman in academia in , in peacetime. I wish there was a way that people like her could actually experience what it was like for these people in WW1 and WW2 or any great trauma that they so easily ignore and dismiss. I think we all know they would absolutely crumble and be a basket case bag of nerves shivering and catatonic from fear, and yet here they are vocally poopooing the sacrifices of others who paid the ultimate price. shame on her","# ::snt yeah screw those white men dying in the trenches in absolutely horrific and terrifying ways, they don't know real suffering. real suffering is being a white woman in academia in , in peacetime.
