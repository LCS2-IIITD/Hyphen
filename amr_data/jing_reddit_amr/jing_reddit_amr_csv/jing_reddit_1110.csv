"British cops lol. I'd just taze everyone that's fucking with you. There shouldn't be a ""fight"". You touch an officer that's it, you're done. The disrespect by all those people not just the woman. If they keep fucking with you, that's why you should have a gun. Every event like this is so comical. That guy literally tackled the officer and ain't shit happen to him. They're afraid to hurt these people cause they can't defend themselves if they piss off the mob. Good luck with the refugee invasion.","# ::snt British cops lol.
