"They keep referencing back to rpg.net's super bulletproof citations for why the policy is just and why they don't have to ban their own circle-jerk politics. I love this ""citation"" for the reason the policy was implemented: *It is clear from context that his embrace of nationalism is a dog-whistled love note to white nationalists.* Where the fuck is the citation? Your opinion is not a citation. smh Or this: *He is attempting to stoke fear and violence in other arenas, as well. [ ]* Link goes to article about speech Trump gave saying that the election is ""referendum on free speech"" among other things and if the republicans lose the left will try and overturn everything he's done and that antifa is violent. But the headline reads ""Donald Trump warns of violence if Republicans lose midterm elections"". I finder if these half-wts even read the article. This is great too: *There are components of his immigration policy that cannot be supported by persons of good conscience. [ ]* Care to make an argument? Anything specific in the policies? No? Just orang man poicies are bad.","# ::snt They keep referencing back to rpg.net's super bulletproof citations for why the policy is just and why they don't have to ban their own circle-jerk politics.
