"Mission accomplished /u/ShaneH7646 added us to the list. Check bottom right of the screen cap. He then promptly locked the submission as his sub was getting torn apart in it. Any sub whose message is so fragile that it needs to ban users, lock threads and censor the fuck out of the narrative is pure comedy. Thanks Shane. Looking forward to you eating your hat when we do not get banned yet again.","# ::snt Mission accomplished /u/ShaneH7646 added us to the list. Check bottom right of the screen cap.
