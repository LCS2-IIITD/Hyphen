"lol nice *""And then that's when I remind them that Hillary and the DNC did this with Ukraine.""* Not to mention obtaining several parts of the steele dossier involved doing essentially what they accuse Trump of but with a few extra steps meant to hide it. Usually when they brag on the Mueller indictments to this point they are heavy on the number of indictments and whatever innuendo they can cram into the argument, but they're quick to drop it when you ask them what they were actually indicted for...because it ruins their entire argument. I see it in the politics sub and with my very liberal friends and family all the time. They're used to speaking about Trump as if he's an actual Russian agent, or at least someone completely beholden to Putin. They just expect others to nod and not question the story, maybe add in a few derogatory playground style nicknames. The look on their face when a formerly liberal-friendly (me) guy challenges their dogma is always funny. Almost as funny as their faces when they suddenly realize they can't back up what they say.","# ::snt lol nice *""And then that's when I remind them that Hillary and the DNC did this with Ukraine.""* Not to mention obtaining several parts of the steele dossier involved doing essentially what they accuse Trump of but with a few extra steps meant to hide it.
