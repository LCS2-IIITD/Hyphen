"At my precinct in Broward at least, it was pages front and back. The pages were split into columns with the Governor race being the first option on the bottom left (all the rules and info took up most of the first column) then at the very top of the nd column was the Senate race followed by all of the judges. I could see people doing the opposite of this trend and completely missing the Govenor vote. Also something strange I encountered was that the scanning machine didnt like the first page of my ballot (straight Republican) and spit it back out at me -3 times before an official came over and told me to flip it over backwards.
