You obviously don't know very many native Africans. They are almost all communists. Their continent is subsidized by white guilt and the ones who move here are no different. They will vote in a communist totalitarian government if that government gives them asylum and saves them from shithole countries. That hurts the Canadians who are already here. Mass immigration is a means of subverting proper democracy and the Soros types are all too eager to help it along for that reason. Do you want to be a slave who can't speak up about the government as you're taxed % of your income so more Africans can live here? >he is a person of this country, thats what happens when you decide to stay there for decades. what the fuck else do you want from people who leave home and choose to live here above anywhere else in the world? .
