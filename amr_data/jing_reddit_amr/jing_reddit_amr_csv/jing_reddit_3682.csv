Just because some authority somewhere gave someone a badge doesnt mean they can just start pushing and grabbing on. In fact this is self defence - raising voices the seesaw that happens the push or grab and then the punch. ! Dude should have been verbal with step away from the counter or what have you. Close proximity no warning they both wanted to dominate the situation. Edit: downvote me to hell - dont matter I have tuns of karma, let it roll. If your all men and visual then you would see what I see and not be a bunch of dence motherfuckers! Just because some bitch used pussypass on you doesnt mean lets all applaud people getting fucked with and beat up. Like I said let it roll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
