"Not even close to the same thing but in the ballpark, the bar that I worked at permanently this obnoxious customer. I ran into her at a different bar and told her I'd rather not speak to her. She kept on trying to talk to me. I got up and walked away. Some white knight confronted me about it. I explained the situation and he left me alone but that could have ended very badly. Another time I had an acquaintance beg me to fuck her luckily I was sober enough to find her friends and have them take her home. Had I been drunk too, I would have taken her up on it. Found out a week later she was notorious for making false rape accusations. Shit! Another time I stopped a drunk girl from driving home. She tried to get me to take her to my place (right around the corner. I went back in and told her friends they needed to deal with her and they accused me of trying to take advantage of her. Once again, I got lucky and my Monday night football girls were in and jumped to my defence. Damn I'm just realizing how lucky I have been in these situations.","# ::snt Not even close to the same thing but in the ballpark, the bar that I worked at permanently this obnoxious customer.
