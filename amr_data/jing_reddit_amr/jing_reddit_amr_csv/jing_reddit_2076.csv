"Freelancer was Chris's baby, his magnum opus, his big dream. It was months late on release and that was only because Microsoft removed Chris from production management and put more effective managers in charge. It released with most of its major promised features either scaled down or stripped entirely, not even having proper DoF movement which was already standard for both contemporary free body and semi-Newtonian flight models. Plus it was so far over budget Chris had to sell his studio to Microsoft where it was stripped of IP and developer assets then shuttered. This is Chris's MO. Wasteful directionless development that breaks its own successes so often that for every five steps forward it takes four steps back. Rather than creating a base mechanical system and then expanding on it, SC now has a hundred modular expansions but the core it in flux and every time it changes all of those modules need reworking. The dev itself is very good at keeping details from the public, but thanks to Star Marine being sent to a third party we know why it died. SIG provided what they claimed was a near final copy of the game engine, some years into development, and the module was built off that.... But of course the core was nowhere near competed so after doing a ton of work getting it sorted Foundry handed back their version and found it was completely incompatible with the game engine SC had moved into by that time. Then, shortly after, SC moved to an entirely different game engine altogether. So the Star Marine module was entirely rebuilt. - for those of you keeping track at home, that means the module was scratch built three times before partial Alpha release, and needs constant work to keep it functional without adding new features or content even now. Chris is currently on a yearly salary of over $900,000, more than even EA's CEO, he has multiple family members on the payroll for a total of over $3 million.... In perspective his families total salary earnings to date are over $20million according to their tax returns. You could develop a solid AAA-level game for that if you start with a functional engine. Is it any wonder people think there's a personal motivation to sell jpegs? That being said, I personally think it's worse than just a simple scam. I think Chris has started to believe his own bullshit, reinforced by the fan base, and doesn't realise he's a great visionary but a shit-tier manager. Now come at me with all your best down votes you StarTards. I'm sure it feels weird to you, changing virtual numbers without needing a credit card.","# ::snt Freelancer was Chris's baby, his magnum opus, his big dream.
