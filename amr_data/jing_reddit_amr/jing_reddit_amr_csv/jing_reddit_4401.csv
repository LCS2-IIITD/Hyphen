"This is the reply the mod sent me minutes ago. He/she is definitely not happy I am challenging my ban. ""Only one paper quoted Mein Kampf, and per your own source included 'passages.' You're falsely claiming they all did and tarring all academics with the same brush for maximum negative discreditation and outrage - and ignoring both the rejected papers and criticisms of the project to do so. You also took discussions on academic works about immigration and inserted that irrelevant discreditation to tear down people in totally different fields to boost your own worldview. Negative generalizations and derailing are the rules you broke. Don't do it again in the future.""","# ::snt This is the reply the mod sent me minutes ago.
