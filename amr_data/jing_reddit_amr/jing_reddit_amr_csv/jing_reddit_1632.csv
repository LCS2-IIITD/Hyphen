But the right wing subs are still being shut down. The only difference is there's no longer a hub subbreddit (BanOut) where people actively targeting right wing subs are congregated. At least not publicly. But the ends they seek still remain and are still being carried out. The subs BanOut targeted are still shut down. The accounts still banned. The comments still deleted. BanOut:2018 is still very much active. Now it's just hidden. Be wary. Edit: I go into further detail on this and connect some dots further down the thread.,"# ::snt But the right wing subs are still being shut down.
