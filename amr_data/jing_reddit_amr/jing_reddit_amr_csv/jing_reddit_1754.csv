"Man, this gets me in the gut. My ex wife disappeared with my son. I found her and got custody modified to joint. That was years ago. Since then she has poisoned my son against me. (I live in NY she and him in GA) she bought him a car at and told him he doesnt need to talk to me any more. I believe the car was part of that. I have not spoken to him in two years. My lawyer suggested that I not fight this until he is because there is no way I can win in the court. The judge will ask my son his opinion as to what he wants. She will come after me for more money and I still wont see him. It sucks. Only a few more months until he graduates high school and I dont have to pay her. If he needs money though or anything he can always come to me. Ill be there for him. Him and him alone. Sorry for the emotional all over the place ramble this really touched me.","# ::snt Man, this gets me in the gut. My ex wife disappeared with my son. I found her and got custody modified to joint.
