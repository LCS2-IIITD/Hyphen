"probably because same people mark a difference between mentally ill people acting out and someone who understands what they consequences of their actions are and consciously chooses to do hate things. of course, theres leeway in that too, like everything else, but im guessing the person balls deep in substance abuse with a history of mental illness isnt a straight up hateful racist so much as whacked out and disturbed but then again i used my brain for longer than seconds and didnt use the first thing i came up with so maybe you can try that next time.","# ::snt probably because same people mark a difference between mentally ill people acting out and someone who understands what they consequences of their actions are and consciously chooses to do hate things. of course, theres leeway in that too, like everything else, but im guessing the person balls deep in substance abuse with a history of mental illness isnt a straight up hateful racist so much as whacked out and disturbed but then again i used my brain for longer than seconds and didnt use the first thing i came up with so maybe you can try that next time.
