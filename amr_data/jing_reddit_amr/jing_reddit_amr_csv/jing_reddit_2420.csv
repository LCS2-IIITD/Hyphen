"I see. Figured if the trend was sizeable there would be some signs visible in other related social stats, something like 'more men choosing to live alone', 'men having sexual relations less' etc... Honestly, I don't put much stock in MGTOW movement because even when I choose to view it in its most positive light, it's still looking like a very short term movement. Social trends like this gain their biggest sway on society from being multi-generational, and that requires that the movement have a strong capacity to persist and be passed down. Best way for that to happen is usually kids growing up with parents who hold such beliefs and taking them as the norm of how things should be. That's the primary way that movements like feminism got so entrenched and wide spread. For obvious reasons, when a man chooses to abstain from starting a family, that man's influence on the next generation becomes next to negligeable. They don't have their own kids to pass on their believes and values to, they don't participate in parent activities and so can't influence other parents who have kids and could also pass on the ideology, they don't tend to care and participate in early education (stuff like PTA) where they could also influence ideology of next generation... So I get that on individual bases, making a choice like that is probably highly positive for that specific guy's life - less stress, more money to spend on himself, and it's generally easy to manage one's own life when everything is up you to decide... But in the long term, his beliefs will likely end with him, meanwhile the social trends that disenfranchised him to begin with are pushed by people who do have kids and pass on their beliefs - so will endure and probably only keep strengthening.
