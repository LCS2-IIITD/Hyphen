Weird thing about pronouns in English is there are only a few. Like he/she/it. Thats just a fact of language. If one or both of the people pronouns offend you then youre left with being called it or something made up like shim or heeshee. Pretty sure nobody wants that either.,"# ::snt Weird thing about pronouns in English is there are only a few. Like he/she/it. Thats just a fact of language.

Id probably use a different construction like is that a boy or girl. Last night I was talking to a buddy that just had a baby. I just said boy or girl?I wouldnt use the are they... construction because it feels really cumbersome since the plurality is off. Some people do though. And Im not saying English is inflexible to this sort of change if thats how people start doing it. It just doesnt quite follow the standard.,"# ::snt Id probably use a different construction like is that a boy or girl. Last night I was talking to a buddy that just had a baby.
