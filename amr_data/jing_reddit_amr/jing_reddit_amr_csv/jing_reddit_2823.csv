"I am left leaning and even I think these people are morons. I don't want to live in an echo chamber, I want people to try and challenge my opinions and then I can challenge their's. I think rape culture is bollocks. I don't like being looked at as a potential rapist even though I am a man. Hell I don't even like female bits (total cock fan). There is an issue with rape.
