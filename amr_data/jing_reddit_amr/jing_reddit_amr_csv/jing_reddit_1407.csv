"I feel like some credit should be given. While ubisoft is promoting SJW values they aren't shoving in their games like other companies. Unlike Marvel or Lucas film where they shove their feminist and SJW ideal into their movies and comics while attacking fans ubisoft has never gone that far. Far Cry was not an attack on Trump or Conservatives, Assassin's Creed Origins wasn't touted as this win for Black Culture or a bigger game then it was like how Black Panther was treated, Assassin's Creed Odyssey does let you choose between a male or female character.

"Yeah I'm kind of surprised. Ubisoft seem to pander more in PR then they do in their actual games. That said, there are definitely undertones if you look for them. Rainbow Six Siege for instance, most of the operators were male in season , by season they're about /50. And you pointed out several more. I guess what I'm saying is, Ubisoft panders in a somewhat superficial way that I've seen so far, unlike say Wolfenstein where they put a woke black women right in your face telling off the protagonist for being a white man.","# ::snt Yeah I'm kind of surprised.
