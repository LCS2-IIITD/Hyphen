"lol, each time I've put up this sort of challenge (never thought to offer $) it always leads right to the Trump tower meeting with Jr. They always keep the accusation vague (for obvious reasons) but when you press for details of exactly what crime was committed there it always devolves into insults (for obvious reasons). Pressed my brother-in-law (super liberal/couple master's degrees) on this and he got to this exact point then seemingly aware of his inability to make his case changed the subject to 'white supremacy'. Unable to help himself while going off on the new subject he referred to Trump as comrade Trump, so of course I pointed out his disconnect between what he says and what he can back up....then he whataboutismed to a non-political subject. They really can't back up their extreme rhetoric.

"lol nice *""And then that's when I remind them that Hillary and the DNC did this with Ukraine.""* Not to mention obtaining several parts of the steele dossier involved doing essentially what they accuse Trump of but with a few extra steps meant to hide it. Usually when they brag on the Mueller indictments to this point they are heavy on the number of indictments and whatever innuendo they can cram into the argument, but they're quick to drop it when you ask them what they were actually indicted for...because it ruins their entire argument. I see it in the politics sub and with my very liberal friends and family all the time. They're used to speaking about Trump as if he's an actual Russian agent, or at least someone completely beholden to Putin. They just expect others to nod and not question the story, maybe add in a few derogatory playground style nicknames. The look on their face when a formerly liberal-friendly (me) guy challenges their dogma is always funny. Almost as funny as their faces when they suddenly realize they can't back up what they say.","# ::snt lol nice *""And then that's when I remind them that Hillary and the DNC did this with Ukraine.""* Not to mention obtaining several parts of the steele dossier involved doing essentially what they accuse Trump of but with a few extra steps meant to hide it.
