Like what anyone who isnt an asshole does so like you? We have fun and make jokes but because you dont like it we are not allowed to. Seems hypocritical to me. People should be allowed to mock things the fact you take it far to seriously sounds like you problem buddy. As for this soapbox you are trying to get on defending dagays I myself am bi (and I love Steven universe) and Im not offended by this. I wont sit here and pretend I speak for any group of people I only speak for myself but that fact you are offended on behalf of a group of people tells me a lot about you. All that aside no one is forcing you to be here and I think few will care about your opinion so come enjoy some memes or dont but do have a good day.,"# ::snt Like what anyone who isnt an asshole does so like you?
