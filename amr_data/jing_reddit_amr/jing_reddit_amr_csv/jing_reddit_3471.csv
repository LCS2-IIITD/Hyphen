"I disagree with a fundamental premise of this article. The author seems to be under the impression that because gaming journalism is inherently shallow, it attracts people who are essentially well-meaning schlubs with no talent. He doesn't stop to consider that the quality may be shit because it's filled with people who are *malicious*; people who aren't just doing this because they like talking about stuff, but people who fucking hate the thing they cover and want to destroy it. And I'm not sure why he thinks this. Is it because gaming publications are inherently aimed at hobbyists and would thus preclude any advancement into serious fields? If so, he should stop to consider that it isn't ; video games are not some thing you do in a basement somewhere. They're a multi-billion dollar industry and so the defense a small hobby has against social climbers is virtually gone. And that's not mentioning how becoming popular within a niche is a well known tactic; it's how the Paul brothers got rich, and Cardi B, and virtually every ""sensation"" since Justin Bieber. Why wouldn't opportunists be lurking around? Why *wouldn't* an industry bigger than movies have people willing to tank their own reputations to destroy it? More to the point, it *is* possible to produce quality content we could describe as ""gaming journalism"". Yeah, rehashing press releases is stupid and non-productive, but there are people who conduct interviews with developers, mess around with hardware, report on the society and culture surrounding games, (in ways that aren't just polemics against consumers) conduct serious reviews of titles, etc, etc. So I don't think ""game journalism sucks because it's just not possible for it not to suck"" is at all a valid stance to take; it's lazy and ignores the fact that gaming publications hire people who fucking hate video games. This naive view of games journalism still being issues of *Nintendo Power* and shit like ""Ctrl+Alt+Del"" is just flat-out wrong. If this guy was a political consultant, he'd be giving advice to candidates in on how to beat Dick Nixon, appeal to the Confederate war veterans in Georgia, and stick it to the USSR.","# ::snt I disagree with a fundamental premise of this article.
