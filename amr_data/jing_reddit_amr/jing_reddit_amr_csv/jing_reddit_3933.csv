"I agree that it's not nearly heavy enough, but at least it's a move in a better direction than most precedent. I think there should be a separate registry for confessed/proven false accusers, one which includes people who commit other major forms of perjury that cause harms to others, because it's fair for them to be marked forever for being willing to abuse power over others and violate others' autonomy and rights. Just like sex offenders. Edit: I found something interesting, at least there's a website trying to accomplish this same purpose independently.
