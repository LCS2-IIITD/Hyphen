"> The media portrays Trump to be an idiot at every opportunity they can By reporting what he says and does? Sure, CNN is biased toward their corporate -- NOT progressive -- agenda and some criticism of Trump is unfounded. But Trump makes himself look like an idiot most of the time. He doesn't understand issues or process or the constitution he swore to protect. Remember when he wanted to take individuals' guns away without due process? Remember when he said tariffs are good because the exporting country pays them, when importers and US consumers actually pay tariffs? Plus, he constantly contradicts himself -- even in the same sentence -- without any help from the media. Trump: > In my plan, (taxes on the rich are) going down, but by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up. He sure knows how to con people, though, which is what he's been doing for decades. Technically Trump lost money on all his scams, because he'd have made more money investing his inheritance in the market. Like everything else about him, Trump's business success is a ruse. So he's not that smart, is he? > The media brainwashes people into getting all riled up about politics so that we hate our neighbour. This is exactly what Trump does when he blames everything on Democrats, no matter how outlandish. Death toll in PR: Democrats. Migrant caravan: Democrats. Mail bombs: Democrats. Legislative gridlock while Republicans hold both houses: Democrats. He sicks his crowds on journalists at every rally, even as one of his followers is sending bombs out. He offers to pay the legal bills for followers who assault protesters. He celebrates a Republican candidate for assaulting a journalist. Trump is the epitome of the us-versus-them mentality. It's never his fault -- always someone else's. Crucially, violence against his opponents is OK, but criticism of him is not. If you say nice things about Trump, then no matter what else you do, you're a good guy. But if you oppose him whatsoever, then you're an enemy. It's not about principle; it's about personal loyalty. That's far closer to how the Nazis operated than anything CNN does. As for economic conditions, real wage growth is virtually nonexistent, but all of the positive trends started under Obama, so the only thing Trump can say is that he hasn't fucked it up yet. Except, his one major economic policy, tariffs, are doing much more to hurt the economy than help. And his only major legislative accomplishment is a massive tax break for the rich that will bankrupt the US just like he's bankrupted so many of his own companies -- including a fucking casino! -- not to mention all the small contractors he never paid. I notice you don't cite the stock market rally, which Trump constantly took credit for, because all the gains from this year were just wiped out, but Trump isn't taking credit for that, is he? Recently, Trump claimed he was going to pass a tax break for middle-income families -- which somehow he forgot in the bill he actually signed -- before yesterday's election. Except congress wasn't sitting again before the election. So, not only is he benefiting the rich and powerful at the expense of the poor and middle class, but either he doesn't know how laws are made or he's betting that his followers don't know either. Even if CNN does lie and manipulate their audience, Trump is doing the exact same or worse. When he calls ANY media criticism of himself ""fake news"" and calls those who report on his lies and misconduct ""enemy of the people,"" he's literally channeling Stalin. And some are lapping it up like warm milk. The only reason Trump's support is as high as it is is because his followers are also living in echo chambers, like Fox News (propaganda arm of the GOP), where any criticism is labeled ""fake"" regardless of merit and lies are repeated ad nauseam. But don't fool yourself, Trump lost the popular vote even with all the Republican gerrymandering, insecure voting machines, and voter suppression. Now, the three swing states he needed to win the electoral college just elected Democratic governors. When the House starts doing its job and investigating Trump's misconduct, things are going to get a lot darker for Trump and Co.","# ::snt > The media portrays Trump to be an idiot at every opportunity they can By reporting what he says and does? Sure, CNN is biased toward their corporate -- NOT progressive -- agenda and some criticism of Trump is unfounded. But Trump makes himself look like an idiot most of the time. He doesn't understand issues or process or the constitution he swore to protect. Remember when he wanted to take individuals' guns away without due process? Remember when he said tariffs are good because the exporting country pays them, when importers and US consumers actually pay tariffs?
