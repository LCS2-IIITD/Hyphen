>I'm frankly embarrassed to have even a single view in common with you idiots. Why? Are you legitimately embarrassed by yourself or is it more like some weird tribal guilt-by-association instinct? If it's the latter maybe you should have some more restraint before castigating other people for their dumb moments.,"# ::snt >I'm frankly embarrassed to have even a single view in common with you idiots.

Hey I just want to say that I see this very similar to you and it's nice to see someone who finds themselves sometimes isolated by both sides. When I see shit on here that I know isn't right it makes me doubt my entire position on any matter and it's difficult for me to take a hardened stance.,"# ::snt Hey I just want to say that I see this very similar to you and it's nice to see someone who finds themselves sometimes isolated by both sides.
