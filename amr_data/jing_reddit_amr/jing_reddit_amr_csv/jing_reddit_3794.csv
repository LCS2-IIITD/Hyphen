">Second, this smacks of the worst sort of colonial racisms, which sought to make American Indians, Africans, and other people of color not just seem less human, but inherently immoral. Making evil races (like the orcs and uruk-hai, as described in The Lord of the Rings, and dark elves, in D&D) dark-skinned creates fantasy worlds that are structured along racist linesand mimicking those that plague us in the real world. It would be foolish to explain that away as mere coincidence. Whether the creators did it intentionally or not, their worlds are loaded with the idea at the core of white-supremacy: that having dark skin is bad. Bullshit. Firstly there were many settings about those other human sub cultures, where you played AS members of those ethnic groups, from Al-Qadim to Maztica. As for the idea that Orc bad because skin green, that's bullshit. There are any number of races with green skin & even darker shades of skin that were not evil, from Dryads, to some species of elves. As for Dark Elves, well they've been depicted with skin running from slate grey to light mauve, to dark purple & yes even obsidian black.","# ::snt >Second, this smacks of the worst sort of colonial racisms, which sought to make American Indians, Africans, and other people of color not just seem less human, but inherently immoral.
