"I can relate, I was a cop working hour shifts alternating days and nights every month. Would get home at am, get woke at am to ""help with kids"" because she ""needed a break"". I finally said look do you want to work? You have a new car, a debit card that you don't have to check the balance, a new home, you get vacations every year, and you don't have to do anything at all but let me sleep for hours when I'm on night shift. Furthermore, I'd come home for lunch on dayshift and you're drinking hot cocoa and watching daytime tv in your PJs lol.","# ::snt I can relate, I was a cop working hour shifts alternating days and nights every month.
