"Many years ago an online friend of mine traveled across the country for Sex Reassignment Surgery. I don't know what the 'rules' are these days ... but she had gone through the entire procedure prior to getting the actual operation. Not the least of which was a lot of therapy and living full time as a woman for a minimum of months. I think it was while we were waiting for her to be taken to theater that we were talking about it, and I asked if she thought the process was too involved. She told me (as best I can recall) that there were times when she felt that it was and was frustrated, but in retrospect that a lot of what was going on was designed to ensure that she was entirely sure about the choice she was making, and as well informed as humanly possible about the consequences. After the surgery (and after she had recovered from the anesthesia which had knocked her around a bit) she was happy. We lost touch a couple of years later, but she was still happy and I hope she still is to this day. I think, as you note, her being happy was because she had been given realistic expectations. Then we see people like Milo Stewart (a transtrender from youtube, if you weren't aware) who just wander off to an 'informed consent' clinic and start hormones with virtually no real preparation. And we see comments saying ""Your so brave"" and ""U r valid"" (yes ... they generally are that illiterate) and then down the track we see them start posting videos like >My Non-Binary Dysphoria Say WHAT? >Asexuality, sex and Kink Which starts with the sentence ""Hi! I'm an asexual and I have a lot of gay sex"". Seriously. >Am I still asexual?! What's my sexual orientation? The gist is ""I no longer identify as asexual"". No shit sherlock. >CONFESSION: I can't orgasm I wonder why? After which Milo had clearly stopped using testosterone and now their voice is all over the place. I compare the two, and I see that one was clearly well prepared for her ordeal. And the other has basically ruined their life.","# ::snt Many years ago an online friend of mine traveled across the country for Sex Reassignment Surgery.
