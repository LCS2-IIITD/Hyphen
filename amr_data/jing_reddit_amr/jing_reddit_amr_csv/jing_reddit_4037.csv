">Rich people have money. Yes. There are people who don't have money. Yes. This doesn't make those who don't have money entitled to the rich peoples money because it's still their money. The wealth gap in itself isn't a reason people deserve more money. The way it came to be kind of is (and I'm not advocating stealing, just challenging the idea rich people should be legally entitled to keep the amount of money we currently let them via tax cuts, etc.). In America right now, businesses operate without much fear for their physical safety. The CEOs take home the lion's share, and the military personnel who kept things safe often become homeless, develop PTSD, and/or kill themselves. Just the other day Mitch McConnell acknowledged they were going to pay for their tax cuts for the rich by cutting social security benefits of ordinary citizens who have been paying in their whole lives. Arguably almost no one makes their fortune without the internet or road system, both of which were funded through an often regressive tax system. You shouldn't take a rich person's money violently, but there's no reason to assume they have a moral right to sit on it the rest of their life.","# ::snt >Rich people have money. Yes.
