"Personally, I don't care what you identify as. Male, female, non-binary, genderfluid, etc? Great, that's all fine, but I hate this whole, ""get rid of gender!!11!!1!!"" thing that's going around now. I, for one, genuinely like being a woman. I wouldn't want to give that up. You have every right to, if you'd like, but just because you feel like you don't fit in with the gender you were born with doesn't mean that gender is this terrible, evil thing. Also, the sign makes no sense.","# ::snt Personally, I don't care what you identify as. Male, female, non-binary, genderfluid, etc?
