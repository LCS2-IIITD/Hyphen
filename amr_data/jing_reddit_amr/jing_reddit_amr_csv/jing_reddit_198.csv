"I've mentored a few women, didn't go down well either. They appeared to lack the ability to retain information and would continually ask me the same questions everyday... which were usually questions about the really basic stuff (never mind optimizing an algorithm). But, I did not always feel this negative about women in STEM. When I started out I was I guess quite left liberal leaning, very optimistic about doing my bit to smash the patriarchy (I actually believed the wage gap was real). Then I started working with Female Developers. I noticed they were always either complaining, gossiping, wasting company time on social media, or asking someone else to do their work. Ok I thought, so maybe I just happened to be put with some bad examples, but all other women developers will be amazing hot shot genius coders... but the same patter was observed at EVERY single IT company I ever worked at. I guess it was an awakening moment, where I realized ""oh shit i've been lied too, women can't code and hate being at work"". Today, I treat women Developers the same way as children. If they ask for help i'll provide it, if I have to work on a project with them i'll do my best, but I have absolutely no expectations from them whatsover and refuse to be surprised when another one is escorted out the building for being completely utterly incompetent.","# ::snt I've mentored a few women, didn't go down well either.
