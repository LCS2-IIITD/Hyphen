"It actually doesn't make much sense to put a woman in prison who is non-violent and unlikely to re-offend. It's done as an example, to discourage crime, but very often people in prisons are introduced to drugs and interact with dangerous criminals and end up much worse members of society when they leave. Prisons are criminal schools. Plus it costs a lot of money to keep someone in prison. So I can understand why they might not want to send someone that committed minor fraud, or was caught smoking weed, to prison. It makes more sense to give them treatment, and only give a prison sentence for re-offenders. But I don't understand why they are singling out women. The policy surely makes sense for men as well? That seems like basic sexism, ""women are wonderful"" effect if they think women don't belong in prison just because they are women.","# ::snt It actually doesn't make much sense to put a woman in prison who is non-violent and unlikely to re-offend.
