"This Carlos guy is the lispy one from the stupid Vox videos. The glasses guy, who explained how Antifa is not bad, ebl right wingers are just making them sound bad. Like why should I care about his opinion when it comes to my sexual activity? Who is this Carlos to tell me what I can do with my vagina? Funny enough, he is the type who screams about politicians trying to control women's bodies if abortions are not provided without question, at all times, perfectly free, with people congratulating the women and throwing pure white rose petals in front of them as they walk. But he tells people who they shouldn't fuck. Okay mate. Ooookay. Nobody should employ Ellen Pao ever. That's fine. Again, she tells others who to employ when she is basically radiocative when it comes to employment? Girl....","# ::snt This Carlos guy is the lispy one from the stupid Vox videos.
