Melbourne has massive issues with Somali and Sudanese*** gangs. The ABC did an article on it showing the stats Sudanese* immigrants are around x more likely to engage in criminal activity) but then went on to say it's racist to do anything about it. Melbourne dropped something like points from being the most livable city in the world in last years rankings. Mainly because it's a left-wing shithole. This is the fucking state of Australian politics... The political Zeitgeist Australia is about years behind the US. We had a great chance with Abbot (I hated him when he was in but I realise now he was a champ) and hopefully we get someone like David Leyonhjelm in in the future.
