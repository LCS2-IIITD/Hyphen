"Which is sad that society is allowed to ruin a mans career because he said something truthful, and not even attacking anyone personally, nor being derogatory toward someone. If a woman can do the same calculations for physics as the man in question, fucking A+, earned that spot. But if they get into a role just because they're a woman/minority, I think that is beyond idiocy.","# ::snt Which is sad that society is allowed to ruin a mans career because he said something truthful, and not even attacking anyone personally, nor being derogatory toward someone.

"I agree. I guess the truth should be backed up a little bit more. It's true that man did the calculations of physics from what we know of that's been documented. There have probably been work from women as well, but it was a different time and women wouldn't be shown the same credit as men, but to be honest a lot of women just didn't get the same education as Men. Men had more leg room back in the day and that's just what way it was. Now it's a different time. Why stay stuck in the pass when you could just learn and change the roles of progress regardless of gender. Just get to there first. I do believe that because of your gender or race you shouldn't get first priority, however we still live an unbalanced society, and some groups need more help than others to be at the same levels as everyone else. Not handouts or given free passes, just some help.","# ::snt I agree. I guess the truth should be backed up a little bit more.
