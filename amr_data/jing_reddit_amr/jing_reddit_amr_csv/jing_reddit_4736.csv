">Lewis's estate as well as hundreds of fans who love the book for it's Christian message are going to be PISSED OFF. Oh, boy, I can already see the shitload of articles about ""toxic/entitled Narnia fans"" and how the Netflix show is not for them so it's okay to make it a tumblr version of it if that's the case, because if you're a fan of something you have to like everything related to it and if you don't eat it up even if it's total bullshit you're an entitled fan and the thing would be better off without fans like you. I'm surprised they choose Narnia, I mean, it has a lot of Christian stuff on the books, but maybe that's why? I don't know, or care, the thing is probably going to suck.","# ::snt >Lewis's estate as well as hundreds of fans who love the book for it's Christian message are going to be PISSED OFF.
