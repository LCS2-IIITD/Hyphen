Why would I want people I don't like to have power over me? One thing that scares me about women in such positions is that they are emotional. They don't think with logic like men. Periods affect the way they think. I've long believed that women should not be allowed to be judges because of their menstrual trial. A stranger should not be able to decide your fate while they are on the rag and are experiencing mood swings and irritability. Men are more emotionally stable and tend to reason with logic over emotion.,"# ::snt Why would I want people I don't like to have power over me?
