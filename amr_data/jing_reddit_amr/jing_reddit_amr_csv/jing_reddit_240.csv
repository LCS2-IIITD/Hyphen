"from the article: >The decision by a seven-judge panel came as an Austrian national identified as E.S. by the court, had held seminars on Islam in and for the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) **where she discussed the prophet's marriage to his wife Aisha, a child at the time, and implied that he was a pedophile.** I consider saying someone married a child is already implying pedophilia. Is it true or not? >Stating that the court had found that ""the applicant's statements had been likely to arouse justified indignation in Muslims"" and ""amounted to a generalization without factual basis"", the Strasbourg-based ECtHR said that the woman's comments could not be covered by the freedom of expression. According to wikipedia there's a source that states precisely that. I guess wikipedia must be also breaking the law. >The court said it ""found in particular that the domestic courts comprehensively assessed the wider context of the applicant's statements and **carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feelings protected,** and served the legitimate aim of preserving religious peace in Austria."" this is where it hits rock bottom, people can have whatever feelings they want for whatever reasons, you shouldn't be responsible for offending those feelings specially when you're stating something that is sourced. An example I've seen is how Galileo also suffered consequences for saying that the Earth orbited the Sun, that also helped protect people's feelings and preserve religious peace. At this point it's an outrage that such court ruling exists, if people can't criticize a religion or ideology then it should also should be against the law to promote such ideology as well as it might go against people's ""religious feelings"" and ""religious peace"".","# ::snt from the article: >The decision by a seven-judge panel came as an Austrian national identified as E.S. by the court, had held seminars on Islam in and for the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) **where she discussed the prophet's marriage to his wife Aisha, a child at the time, and implied that he was a pedophile.** I consider saying someone married a child is already implying pedophilia.
