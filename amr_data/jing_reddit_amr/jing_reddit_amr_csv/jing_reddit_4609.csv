Actually.. Swastika has been a Hindu symbol for s of years first appearing in Vedic Hindu scriptures. It has more to do with prosperity or auspiciousness. Growing up my family would draw it before Gods portraits before festival prayers. I have a lot of Budhists in my family too and as I understand from them Budha was a Hindu who got enlightened which is why Hinduism and Budhism has a lot of similarities. I have no idea though why or how it became a Nazi symbol. Happy to be educated on the subject.,"# ::snt Actually..
