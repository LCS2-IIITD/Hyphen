"I'm pretty sure I remember the argument towards Hammond being ""OH COME ON BLIZZARD YOU GIVE US A HAMSTER AND NOT A STRONG TRANS BLACK WOMAN?"". I remember seeing a few posts implying that blizzard hated trans women of color so much that they decided a hamster needed more representation, I really wish I could say that was satire. I'm sure even if they did release a character like that at this point, it would be considered offensive because they'd still be racist or sexist due to some trait of the character.","# ::snt I'm pretty sure I remember the argument towards Hammond being ""OH COME ON BLIZZARD YOU GIVE US A HAMSTER AND NOT A STRONG TRANS BLACK WOMAN?"".
