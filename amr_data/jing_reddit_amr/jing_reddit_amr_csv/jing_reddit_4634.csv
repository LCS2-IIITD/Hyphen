">Moderation doesn't require that content be removed. ... It just hid them from default view That doesn't really change anything about what the report says. The report doesn't say *how* to moderate users. >I disagree that this is something that should be the responsibility of the people who run the platform. The platform administrators should concern itself with things that destabilize the platform, and provide tools so the users themselves can control the content they see. That doesn't really effect the report either. Again, it doesn't say *how* to establish moderation. Just that people want to know what the rules are. Using your way, people would certainly understand what the rules are because they would be the ones moderating it. >Usenet is perhaps a better example... I don't think this really addresses anything. >Perhaps not, but it may suggest that being politically neutral is one of those things that sounds easy but in practice is really hard or impossible. To be *perfectly* politically neutral, like being *perfectly* objective is very hard. However, it isn't an impossible feat to get within less than standard deviation of neutral. >True, but I might be able to run up to a friend and do that without being hit. Are tech platforms able to make that sort of distinction? So far they haven't done so, either because they don't want to, because it's a hard problem for the AI systems they're using, or because the content being flagged is being reviewed by someone who doesn't understand the context well enough to make the distinction. Tech platforms are not your friends. No institution is capable of emotion or affiliation. My extreme example is meant to demonstrate that tone policing *must* occur in any social environment, either by an authority, or the individuals involved. >They say that in context of changing their rules over time. I didn't see anything in reference to suggesting allowing have control over moderation. I agree that they don't say that users have control over moderation. It's that users make demands over time that have to be accommodated, justifying changing the rules when necessary to accommodate those demands.","# ::snt >Moderation doesn't require that content be removed. ...
