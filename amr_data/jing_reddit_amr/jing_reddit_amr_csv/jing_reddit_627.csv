"I was at a neighborhood community center last week with my kid, and a few other moms were there with their toddlers. The toddlers were all boys. One mom was loudly and dramatically talking about how devastated she was when she found out she was having a boy because she wanted to raise a strong feminist girl and she was now tasked with teaching a boy her feminist values. I had to leave at that point.","# ::snt I was at a neighborhood community center last week with my kid, and a few other moms were there with their toddlers. The toddlers were all boys.
