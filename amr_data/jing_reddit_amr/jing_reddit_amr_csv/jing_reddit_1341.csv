"> The whole gate suffix is ridiculous, said North. It doesnt mean anything: theres no scandal here. Watergate had a break-in. Gamergate at least had the (thoroughly discredited) idea that there was something fishy around ethics in game journalism. Comicsgate has nothing no scandal, no event, nothing to prove and nothing to deny beyond I dont like some comics and would like for them not to exist.' Lol - this guy has no idea what he's talking about re: GG. At least Liana tries to be somewhat sensible in this, even in a 'this whole thing is a dumb internet slapfight' sense. Edit: IDK if this shit counts as a 'scandal', but there's certainly been some fuckery from comics pros and related internet entities (if OAG is borked again look them up on archive).","# ::snt > The whole gate suffix is ridiculous, said North.
