There is a similar variation between a Mastiff and a German Shepard but that doesn't mean the veterinarian goose steps to work. You have any sources to support your claim regarding the irrelevance of skull shape? Because I can provide thousands that refute said claim. Ever pick up an anthropology textbook? Tell me more about the Nazis that claimed germans and jews are of the same race because that is the contention of the source I provided. Your entire comment history is name calling and low-end dick jokes. Nazi seems to be one of your favorites. There isn't a single line of thoughtful discourse in the entire canon.
