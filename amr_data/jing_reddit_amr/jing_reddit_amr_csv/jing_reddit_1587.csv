"Not necessarily. Have you ever considered solipsism? The view where your perceptions are basically the only thing that exists, without any deeper reality to speak of (this includes other people, who essentially exist only to the point they interact with you). Its actually impossible to refute this point of view, people just dismiss it because it sounds crazy. It sounds crazy because it is crazy, but bear with me: imagine that for real there were nothing else in the world besides you* and your thoughts/perceptions. Do you still think spellcasting wouldnt work? If all reality is taking place literally in your own head, wouldnt you thoughts (and words and so on) have immense power? Like when you are dreaming, and it feels like its you in the dream, but actually everything in the dream is you. *strictly speaking you dont even need to exist, as you never directly observe yourself (you are not a single thought or perception).","# ::snt Not necessarily.
