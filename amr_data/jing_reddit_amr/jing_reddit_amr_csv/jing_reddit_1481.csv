"If you're from North America/Western Europe then actually they will be better for you. They cost much less and look better (on average, thanks to fakeup and fancy clothes). They're also noticeably slimmer. Plus, feminism isn't nearly as bad here as it is in the West, so there're still enough unspoiled women in Russia, especially in rural areas. But, under the surface, I think there's no real difference. People are people, we're all the same. Sometimes I pretend like I'm an American tourist and speak English with Russian girls. You should see their faces So traditional all of a sudden.","# ::snt If you're from North America/Western Europe then actually they will be better for you.
