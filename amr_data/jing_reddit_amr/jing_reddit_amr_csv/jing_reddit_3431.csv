I don't know. But look at this thread and imagine all the people that are deluded into thinking that 'if the races were reversed automatically the perps would get lynched.' Isn't that absolutely batshit crazy?,"# ::snt I don't know.

"Of course it is. Racism is still alive in America though. And it goes both ways, granted one more than the other most of the time. If that situation happened somewhere other than the back woods of Idaho it would have probably ended differently. But racism does not justify racism. Both of these stories are fucked up and both are based in racial hatred, just on opposite sides. So this should still be a hate crime and she should have gotten a heavier sentence, just like those piece of shit kids in Idaho deserved too.","# ::snt Of course it is.
