A woman can be spoiled and entitled without being a feminist. I've met quite a few conservative redneck chicks who try to fight men.,"# ::snt A woman can be spoiled and entitled without being a feminist. I've met quite a few conservative redneck chicks who try to fight men.

Its the assumption that simply because shes young and cute she must also be an entitled spoiled brat. That's pretty incel. Also for all those saying shes not going to reach out to me and I'm white knighting sorry to burst your fairy land but I'm a girl who likes dick so I'm not any of those things. I just think it's important to try and keep your head out of your ass and not assume things based on your prejudice.,"# ::snt Its the assumption that simply because shes young and cute she must also be an entitled spoiled brat.
