"Thats rage inducing. As soon as an honest senator calls out this disingenious hag for her biggotry, she uses it to start a fundraiser and cry ""muh oppression, give me even more money I did not earn"". As if she did not get enough tax money already. What are you supposed to do, call her out and allowing to enrich herself further with that victim narrative? We need the boondock saints, should go well with an aussie accent instead of irish.","# ::snt Thats rage inducing.
