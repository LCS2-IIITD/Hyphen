"University journalism programs are basically SJW-mills. They're one step up from gender studies programs. The average journalism professor spends the entire class period ranting about Trump, the patriarchy, conservatives, white privilege, and the evils of capitalism - no objective journalism or critical thinking skills are actually taught. The least attractive and least talented of these freshly indoctrinated ham-beasts typically have to settle for low paying gaming journalism gigs because they can't get real jobs. So now they're extra mad at the patriarchy. Hell, most of them never played a video game in their life besides minutes or Mario Kart that they sucked at and rage-quit when they were kids. Is it any wonder that these people only care about pushing their political opinions? They don't even play the games they review. That would require too much hard work and hard work is for white male shitlords.","# ::snt University journalism programs are basically SJW-mills. They're one step up from gender studies programs.
