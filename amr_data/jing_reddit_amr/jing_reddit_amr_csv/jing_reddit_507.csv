"The whole thing around ""cultural appropriation"" has exactly ZERO NOTHING to do with cultural appropriation. It is PURELY an excuse for SJW's to get triggered so they can attempt to project their ideological power to control you. It is a social purity / conformity game, that makes no fucking sense AT ALL with respect to the actual merits of people of different cultures learning and borrowing from each other. This is why my response to them is not about cultural appropriation, it is about GET FUCKED WITH YOUR BOGUS FABRICATED POWER TRIPPING IDEOLOGICAL INSANITY. If I was going to even stoop to addressing their nonsensical notion that somehow it's not OK for people to share culturally, then I would begin by telling everyone else on the planet they are no longer allowed to speak or write in English, or to print anything with printing presses. All the indigenous people of North America can give up all use of metal, leave our grocery stores alone, and go back to eating meat and berries and fish and wearing nothing but leather and woven plant fibers they process by hand. Because that's how this actually works, if you want to actually add up who could be said to be ""appropriating"" from whom. The reality is there is no such thing outside the warped power tripping of SJW maniacs. The sane people in the world call it progress, and celebrate sharing all the good things with our neighbors, because they are good and beautiful, and sharing brings us all closer together. SJW's are regressive authoritarian idiots.","# ::snt The whole thing around ""cultural appropriation"" has exactly ZERO NOTHING to do with cultural appropriation.
