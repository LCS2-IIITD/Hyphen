"Idk, sounds like a troll that went a little far. I'll admit that it would have been more fair if she had paid for her own meal, but the guy willingly paid for her at that point and time. There was no catch to that transaction. If you wanna pay for a woman's meal on a date then thats fine, but don't expect them to owe you anything afterwards because of it. That same train of thought is what every ""niceguy"" is following. ""Oh I complimented her on her social media, but she doesn't want to fuck me? Stupid whore!"" Grow up man, this is how adult dating goes. If a girl doesn't text you back be a man about it and move on to someone else. Probably gonna get downvoted for this but fuck it","# ::snt Idk, sounds like a troll that went a little far.
