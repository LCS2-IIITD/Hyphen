"Gaming/nerd culture +2 Journalism/ethics +2 Media Meta +1 Related politics +1 Orgs persons under attack by media +1 This might be stretching a little but I think it warrants inclusion here because the entire narrative around this movie is that it is misunderstood parody of fascism which, like most things these days, is a complete fabrication for people own ends. If youve ever watched the movie and just not quite gotten the parody theres a reason why; The movie itself parodies the fascist society within Heinleins book of the same name. This is the conventional wisdom about this movie. Except there is no fascist society in the book. It is portraying what is actually a liberal utopia. This is why, as the video explains, what we are shown of the government in the film, never once shows a fascist government. And despite being clad in nazi uniforms, the government is more transparent and liberal then any government on Earth, or in history. The reason this disconnect exists is because Paul Verhoeven **never actually read the book**. And this is a well enough known fact that it is actually on the Wikipedia page for the movie. Once again a favourite progressive talking point is complete nonsense and a pure fabrication. Its merely a lie repeated over and over again, by many journalistic outlets, without a single verification. So if you loved this movie, theres yet more reasons to love it. This videos mins long but its some of Sargons best, and it literally made me order the book to read myself.","# ::snt Gaming/nerd culture +2 Journalism/ethics +2 Media Meta +1 Related politics +1 Orgs persons under attack by media +1 This might be stretching a little but I think it warrants inclusion here because the entire narrative around this movie is that it is misunderstood parody of fascism which, like most things these days, is a complete fabrication for people own ends.
