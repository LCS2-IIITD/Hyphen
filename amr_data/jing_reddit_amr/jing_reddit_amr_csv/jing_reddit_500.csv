"Huh, could have swore pot wasn't illegal on a federal level anymore and it's just that most states still have it on the books. I figured it was like fireworks, where they're illegal to own in my state, but you can just buy them in the next state over. That being said, I think there's a difference between selling locally and adhering to those local laws and selling country-wide both digitally and physically. And correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't places that sell pot in California smaller places and not these big conglomerates? Not that niche publishers are big conglomerates either, but they're still paying federal taxes and get more spread out coverage for their products.","# ::snt Huh, could have swore pot wasn't illegal on a federal level anymore and it's just that most states still have it on the books.
