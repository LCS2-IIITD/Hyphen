"This isn't even a debate. Brock turner is a garbage human being, and you're using the weakest debating strategy on earth. When women do it, it's okay!"" is a dumbcunt argument. Your argument should not be equating us; Your argument should be ""while I realize women struggle with lots of social hardships like stigmas and the threat of being overpowered by a man, men, who are mostly good people, go through hardships as well. Hardships that many women don't recognize or even realize exist, and here they are (1), (2), (3). So, my goal is not to make women feel like they are the responsibility of shitty women, because I am not responsible for the behavior of shitty men, but rather for us to come together on our issues and figure out the way forward that benefits everyone."" THAT is an argument, not ""ya but brock turner used a pinecone lol"" fuck out of here with that shit, dumbass.","# ::snt This isn't even a debate.

"Starting off your argument with the irrelevant comment about my typing detriments your argument, as it shows you do not have much of value to say so u would rather talk about my typing. Men are the majority victim of every other violent crime. Yes sometimes we do worry about being kidnapped (men get kidnapped more than women tho u r right about the ass fuck part) and we do worry about getting mugged or killed, however unlike women, men are not constantly parading around telling everyone about our fears in order to get some sort of sympathy or special treatment. The only reason we bring these points up Is when WOMEN bring up how scary their lives are and we are tired of hearing their whining. I appreciate you bringing up points related to mens issues, however, to get back to your original comment when you said ""brock Turner used a pinecone is a bullshit arguement"", I was merely bringing up laws because she had decided to do so. If she had not talked about how women who rape men are technically not rapists according to law, I would not have brought up the fact that he was not a rapist. And also this is why I asked for her view about brock Turner. If she had ALSO said that he was not a rapist then there would also be no reason to bring it up. However she called him an evil rapist. Though he is evil and should rot in hell, to use her words""according to the laws"" he is not a rapist, which proves that she has put herself in a juxtaposition in terms of her views on the different issues, ultimately proving her bias against men.
