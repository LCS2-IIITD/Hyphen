They're way more likely to act charitable when there's an audience,"# ::snt Honestly it seems like the whole savior complex thing is usually all about just showing off how virtuous they are.

Yup. You are right. They will write checks to orgs and then talk about how they did so. They don't just go and do it silently. It has to be a spectacle.,"# ::snt Yup. You are right.

"Is it possible, sure, but she's a politician of a party representing her party who has a history of staging these meaningless disruptions because they don't believe laws of the land should apply to all people equally. Simply put she's a self professed SJW that lives in a moral bubble of a particularly fringe culture even in an already left leaning system. To your point, she likely does believe some of her convictions on this issue; but the fact that she and her party are known for staging these meaningless protests is at least suspiciously framed for media coverage and self aggrandisement as evidenced by her. It is PPD because she assumes that as a Female/Feminist politician she has the right to not only breach the peace but circumnavigate an entire legal system that has seen fit to deport an individual because of his actions. She has to believe either that imposing her countries values/laws, values/laws that the Afghan man accepted to adhere to upon entry, is a racist/bigoted act, or that it is not applicable on what I suspect is the basis of his skin color or refugee status, or she believes the man too feeble to understand his wrongdoing, which paradoxically is extremely bigoted to assume.","# ::snt Is it possible, sure, but she's a politician of a party representing her party who has a history of staging these meaningless disruptions because they don't believe laws of the land should apply to all people equally.
