The problem I have is that she was standing still and the cop walked up to her then pushed her. I'm sure anyone here would have gotten pissed off too if you were standing on a public sidewalk and a cop walked up then pushed you when you haven't done anything wrong. I don't see this as a PPD so much as a cop with a Napoleon complex.,"# ::snt The problem I have is that she was standing still and the cop walked up to her then pushed her.

At the second mark. She stops and turns around to see what going on. The cop continues to walk up and push her with his left hand. After that he tries to push her again with his right hand and she pushes his hand away saying you don't need to touch me. Which she's right. When is it ok for a cop to just walk up and put their hands on you? He started and escalated the whole situation.,"# ::snt At the second mark. She stops and turns around to see what going on.
