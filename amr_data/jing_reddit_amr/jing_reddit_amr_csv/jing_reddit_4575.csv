"Oh yeah, vegan, keto and intermitent fasting did great in reducing my libido, thank god. As for the issue with women demanding anything from men the solution is easy dump them. I dont even fight them anymore. I just nod, write it down, and before they know it, its over. All relationships end. But the trick i found that works for me is to never let them get away even with a small manipulative behavior, because thats how it starts. If she gets away with it, she then will slowly escalate, and then you find yourself living like a vegan cuck lmao. So yeah, if she starts being manipulative or demanding its time to go. Even if you dont let them get away with anything they will still try it. So yeah.","# ::snt Oh yeah, vegan, keto and intermitent fasting did great in reducing my libido, thank god.
