"I disagree with this. If a friend invites me to watch a movie and grab a burger afterwards I don't expect them to pay for either of those things for me, why should it be different here? I am not saying you should never treat a date to a meal or something I have done so in the past with girlfriends. But why would I pay for a first date? I barely even know if I like the person in this sort of context and we are both investing time to see if we are interested in each other. Additionally, I have heard several women talk about dating with the goal being free food. I don't really feel like dealing with that. If whether or not a girl wants to go out with me depends on me buying her some free shit then I just saved us both some time, because I don't want to go out with her anymore.","# ::snt I disagree with this.
