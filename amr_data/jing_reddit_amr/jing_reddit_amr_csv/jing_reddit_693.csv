"Bi as well and hate the community as well. Though because of the Biphobia and how ''cool'' it is, to hate ""the straights"" and how most of them treat it like it's a cool club to get into, so they create sexualities and genders so they can squeeze in. Being Gay shouldn't be a trend, it should just be something that should be normalized.","# ::snt Bi as well and hate the community as well.
