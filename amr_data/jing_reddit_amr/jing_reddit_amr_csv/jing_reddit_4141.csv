"I'm surprised major news outlets like Polygon are still around. Aside from alienating potential readers with incredibly divisive articles, these are the same sorts of people that will claim that they're ""objective"" and have no bias... Yet they also run advertisements (being paid by the companies that these games are coming out of) for the newest and biggest games/movies coming out soon, sometimes on the very same page of their review of said biggest games/movies. How more people haven't figured that the sites like Polygon lack any sort of journalistic integrity or ethics, is beyond me. How sites like Polygon stay afloat, I have no clue. Sooner that these sorts of sites die off, the better. They contribute absolutely nothing of value to anything in the entertainment industry.","# ::snt I'm surprised major news outlets like Polygon are still around.
