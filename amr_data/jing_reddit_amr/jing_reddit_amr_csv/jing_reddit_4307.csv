"My brother's fiance makes probing comments to me all the time. The funny thing is my brother is pretty much everything you'd want in a guy, tall, handsome, intelligent and a loving father. He earns a good living in a respectable field but I earn a lot more than him, and she's *very* interested in that. The probing questions are always about money, stupid comments when we're alone like "" I bet you have a big dick like your brother"" and "" you need to teach him how to be romantic like you"" My wife despises her. As soon as she met her she said she was trouble. The weird thing is that she's actually a genuinely kind person but just doesn't respect boundaries. End of the day it's none of my business. I avoid her as much as I can without upsetting my brother. He's a great guy and is already starting to connect the dots with her and will be fine when they inevitably split.","# ::snt My brother's fiance makes probing comments to me all the time.
