">One of the trios hoax papers, published in April by the journal Fat Studies, claims bodybuilding is fat-exclusionary and proposes a new classification . . . termed fat bodybuilding, as a fat-inclusive politicized performance. Editor Esther Rothblum said the paper had gone through peer review, and the author signed a copyright form verifying authorship of the article. This author put a lot of work into this topic, she said. It is an interesting topic, looking at weight and bodybuilding. So I am surprised that, of all things, theyd write this as a hoax. As you can imagine, this is a very serious charge. She plans to remove the paper from the Fat Studies website. Okay, look, either you stand behind your peer review and the content of the paper, or your whole process is bullshit. By removing it you're basically stating that your site and process are bullshit and you don't really believe any of the things you publish. E: I feel a little sorry for the Journal of Poetry Therapy guy - he sounds genuinely sad that he got duped, and based on the title it doesn't sound very political, but maybe the title is deceptive.","# ::snt >One of the trios hoax papers, published in April by the journal Fat Studies, claims bodybuilding is fat-exclusionary and proposes a new classification . . . termed fat bodybuilding, as a fat-inclusive politicized performance.
