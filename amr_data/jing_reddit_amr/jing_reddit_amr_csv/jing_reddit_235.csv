"TLR: Kotaku ""journalist"" cries out to the Maple Story dev team after finding out that the in-game marketboards are being flooded with Trump, MAGA and NPC Wojak meme-themed products. She starts spouting the usual shit like ""these people are crazy white supremacists, think of the kids, this allows for hate crimes, etc."" Meanwhile she argues that MS2 is a kids' game due to its aesthetics and completely ignores the fact that there's so much NSFW/borderline SFW (you know the ""questionable"" tag on gelbooru ? yeah.) that's been going around ever since the actual release. This is the best I can do to sum it up, I'm trying to deal with my flu's symptoms so sorry.","# ::snt TLR: Kotaku ""journalist"" cries out to the Maple Story dev team after finding out that the in-game marketboards are being flooded with Trump, MAGA and NPC Wojak meme-themed products.
