"> Charlies Angels Reboot Just reading these words made me feel like I'm gargling boiling hot excrement... Which is probably not as bad as this steaming pile of dogshit. If there was ever any doubt that Hollywood has gone to absolute trash, there's your answer... I mean I can understand these celbtard imbeciles destroying the classics. But now it seems they are sooo out of any ideas, they're starting to reboot the garbage. Can't blame them tho, what else is there to ruin... They ruined and humiliated Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Ocean's (77% of it), Predator, Alien, Terminator (twice), Jurassic Park... Expect reboots of Twilight, Hunger Games, Titanic, Shades of Grey and Birdemic. Fucking hell...","# ::snt > Charlies Angels Reboot Just reading these words made me feel like I'm gargling boiling hot excrement... Which is probably not as bad as this steaming pile of dogshit.
