"""anymore"" presuming they ever did. If they don't it's the result of the system that your generation and those before you have set up. Students go to learn, not apply. Universities are commended by how well they've learnt not how well they've applied their learnings. The guy at the end is right, this presenter only cares about his fame and youtube followers, not about the issues. He's found a great little niche to generate a following, pretty smart. It's just a shame that people view these videos as if they are somehow proving something either way. Nothing is gained by either watching or making these videos. Both sides walk away from having watched his videos with a stronger view on their own opinion. It's so sad to watch society tear itself a part for views.","# ::snt ""anymore"" presuming they ever did.
