"That's what you get for believing feminist bullshit. Even here in the US, feminists try to pretend that women are ""under represented"" in government.....despite the fact women vote more than men.....which means they are the ones more often voting for men over women. Of course feminists have an answer for this.....which just so happens to be the same answer every single time a woman disagrees with them.....those women all have ""internalized misogyny""......which is feminist for ""those women don't count"".","# ::snt That's what you get for believing feminist bullshit.
