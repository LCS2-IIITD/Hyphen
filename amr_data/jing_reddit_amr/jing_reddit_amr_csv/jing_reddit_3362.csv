"> ""We want people to live in a culturally-appropriate setting, said Councillor Joe Cressy, of Ward Trinity-Spadina. That's unbelievable. Even more so, is that he knew that question was coming (he agreed to the interview, he knew the rough questions he'd be asked), and that's the excuse he masterminded. It's almost verbatim an excuse used to keep black people out of white neighbourhoods in the south in the s. Literally, ""we think they'd feel more comfortable among their own"". Cressy literally is mouthing those same words, and worse he had time to think and come up with this line of argument. And the double down on that, and to then flip the problem as to say that the only problem is that we don't have MORE segregation sufficient for everyone's bigotry, shows you how little repercussion white liberals face for their bigotry. The left is the home of racism and bigotry today, it's just insane.","# ::snt > ""We want people to live in a culturally-appropriate setting, said Councillor Joe Cressy, of Ward Trinity-Spadina.
