"Yeah, cuz that's a good lesson to teach kids. ""It's not okay to hit someone... unless they're saying something REAL bad."" Again, if in reality everyone's solution was to just beat up those who are saying 'icky' things, we'd be in utter chaos. Moral high ground isn't limited to one aspect of life. In fact i'd argue that it's harder to keep that position on the internet than irl. This isn't from a 'behind a keyboard' stance, this is a 'recalling my own past' stance. I've been there, and I did the opposite of what this guy did. I reported them. I didn't even have video proof like this dude does. Luckily they took my word for it, and the other kid was suspended. Dude never picked on me again, problem solved. Or, are you saying I should've beat that kid up, and then gotten suspended myself? But at least i'd FEEL like a winner, right? Someone my parents could be proud of? lol","# ::snt Yeah, cuz that's a good lesson to teach kids. ""It's not okay to hit someone... unless they're saying something REAL bad.""
