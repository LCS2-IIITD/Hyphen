"Did I feel attacked? No. Did I feel that your comment was pretty pointless? Better. And I didnt admit anything, my entire argument is that the inaccuracy of some reddit thread title should have absolutely zero effect on how someone looks at this situation. And that in the *real* world, most people wouldnt care to make the distinction for this man when they saw his name. Whether you believe it or not, that is what matters in this case. The public eye. And by the way, my shovel analogy accounts for public reaction, which again, is what matters here. People give a shit about the difference between life and death, contrasting to the grouping of all sexual offenses as one prime offense against women or whatever. You may be smart enough to make the distinction, but dont have faith in everybody else to follow suit.","# ::snt Did I feel attacked? No. Did I feel that your comment was pretty pointless? Better.
