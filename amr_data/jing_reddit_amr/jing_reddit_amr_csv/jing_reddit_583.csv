"That was decided in , with language that had no definition as to what an obscenity actually is, how one actually determines what is an obscenity, and what any of the terms involved are. You might as well argue that the Supreme Court upheld slavery at one point, which it did, so why argue against slavery? As I said, the Supreme Court has attempted to punt at every opportunity on deciding the actual use of Miller or exact definition of obscenity. In the age of porn on demand, and expanding protections for non-political free speech in America, one good criminal prosecution that doesn't end in a plea deal could see an appeal go to the SC. And morals are not the basis of the Constitution. That's a conservative fantasy. Rights are not based on morals. They're granted by the virtue of existing. Free speech doesn't exist because your sky wizard commands it. It's a right derived from the need of the individual, and it doesn't require the agreement of the state or of others. The Constitution guarantees individual rights, not group rights, because those rights exist naturally for the individual. Obscenity is the very definition of a group punishment upon the individual, the offense of others as a reason to inflict tyranny on the minority. Honestly, conservatives make me sick sometimes. The willingness of such types to lock someone up for making drawings or writing novels, to deprive them of liberty because their sky god's jimmies are rustled, as interpreted by self-proclaimed priests and their captive politicians. Anyone that would lock up another human being for scribbles on paper should never speak of standing for anything resembling human dignity. They're more at home with the Taliban than the West. And they shouldn't throw stones at their leftist counterparts who also seek to control the thoughts of others. They're the same fucking thing.","# ::snt That was decided in , with language that had no definition as to what an obscenity actually is, how one actually determines what is an obscenity, and what any of the terms involved are.
