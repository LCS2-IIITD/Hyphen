"Right. And what's worse is that year w/o possibility of parole is a life sentence. By she is going to be physically incapable of attacking an yo, and while on a sex-offender list she is virtually no danger. These sentences are virtue-signalling as bad as SJWs do. It's also cruel & unusual. An yo cannot consent, but it's also not violent forcible rape. What would they do if she had committed violent forcible rape? They can't give the death penalty, so they sentence her to years? is already a death sentence. And if she got death for violent forcible rape, what about someone who rapes and kills yo children? What are you going to do then? This is nothing but stupid Texas virtue signalling. Fuck you Texas and your meme prison.","# ::snt Right.
