"It's an interesting argument, isn't it? Technically speaking, if you live with a man, you are more likely to get assaulted or attacked, because men commit more crimes like that. The logic is absolutely sound. However, it's *also* logical, in that case, to also write 'no blacks', because black people commit more crime, proportionally speaking, than white people, so if you live with a black person, you're more likely to get assaulted or attacked. I wonder if this woman would be happy to have the same logic applied to race, as she applies to gender. Or whether she would suddenly shout 'no way, that's racist!'. Another thought that I had is that, if we take it as correct that men are stronger and more physically dangerous than women, on average, that could work to your advantage, as well as your disadvantage, if you were a woman living with a man; this is because, if someone attacked you in your home (e.g. a burglary or something), the male you are living with would be able to defend you better than a woman could. It's a shame we can't have discussions about this rationally without it turning into an unpleasant argument. Anyway personally speaking I think it's unfair to judge someone based on their race, gender or sexuality, it's more important to meet the person and find out what they're like, than to look at what gender they are and instantly dismiss them based on that. But I understand women who are afraid of sharing with guys they don't know, I honestly do understand the logic. I would be wary of sharing a place with *anyone* I didn't know well, regardless of their race, gender, or sexuality; I think people in general are fucking awful.","# ::snt It's an interesting argument, isn't it?

I totally agree with you. I also very much understand the point why women usually do not prefer men roommates but what I don't understand is the very rude conversation she had and also the fact that maybe most of these female only ads are posted for places who actually have only men tenants or both men and women. If all these female only ads are posted for places which only have female tenants that means over half of places that have rooms for rent in Toronto are female only as well which cannot be correct.,"# ::snt I totally agree with you.
