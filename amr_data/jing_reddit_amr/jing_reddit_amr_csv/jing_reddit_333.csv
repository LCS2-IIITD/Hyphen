"how do men want women to look? emaciated and a push over! So men can play being heroes to the damsels in distress and really that's the only role men want to play Men don't want women who dont look emaciated and a pushover, cos those kind of women frighten men and how can men act out their role of being heroes if women don't need heroes? How can men call themselves manly if women are as manly as men? Certainly men don't want to call that being feminine, not when they don't recognise that might be part of being a man? Women can build up their strength, their weight, their muscles and flex them just as much as any man.. yikes, men say, give her a miss boys, she isn't pandering to the likes of us men?","# ::snt how do men want women to look? emaciated and a push over!
