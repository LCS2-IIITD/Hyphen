But why would you have Riesling with a Sriracha slider? (Serious Question). I thought it was a really sweet white wine. Wouldn't a Chardonnay be better?,"# ::snt But why would you have Riesling with a Sriracha slider? (Serious Question). I thought it was a really sweet white wine. Wouldn't a Chardonnay be better?

Short answer: Sweetness and acidity brings balance to heat. Long answer: Riesling can be made into a variety of styles (bone dry to dessert) and is arguably the most versatile wine making grape. Often times when you ask a sommelier what their favorite varietal is they will answer with riesling. Riesling and spicy food is a classic pairing due to the grapes intense acidity and often times off-dry style. EDIT: Replied before I saw the poster above me already had.
