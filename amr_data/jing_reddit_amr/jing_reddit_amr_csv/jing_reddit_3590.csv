"Had a similar story. Was in Rio a few years back with a buddy who was a bodybuilder. Guy was absolutely RIPPED. We go to a bar and are having some drinks and we see two girls we want to talk to. So we go over and chat them up. The one he's talking to apparently revealed that they were both prostitutes. She told him that if he wanted to sleep with her there'd be a price. Without missing a beat, he immediately replies, ""Why would I pay you? You should be paying me. I'm in better shape than you are!"" She got so upset and stormed out hahahaha","# ::snt Had a similar story. Was in Rio a few years back with a buddy who was a bodybuilder. Guy was absolutely RIPPED.
