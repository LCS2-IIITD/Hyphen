The law was upheld to be valid as long as the work is deemed [obscene per the miller test]() in both the [Whorley]() and [Handley]() cases. The Handley case did cite that the sections that don't also require the work to be deemed obscene were too overbroad but they also cited that, ""This conclusion has minimal impact on this case given the almost complete redundancy of the conduct criminalized by subsections A(a)(1) and (b)(1) (SIC: The sections requiring obscenity) with that of subsections A(a)(2) and (b)(2) (SIC: The sections not requiring obscenity).""

You can find some searching the [court archives of them too](). It's important to keep in mind that DA's typically like to charge you with anything they can think of and see what sticks. Being convicted of this law along with other violations doesn't negate the fact that loli pornography, which is going to be deemed obscene, is still illegal all on it's own. Also it's important to realize that prosecutions for this are really rare. It's typically used as a way to add time to a sentence or as a way to get you for something if their original accusations fail in a similar fashion to how Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion. >If prosecutions are so rare than it doesn't matter. It's true the prosecutions are rare, as LewdGamer's essay clearly outlined. It's as likely for a private citizen nobody to get caught solely for this as they are of being caught downloading movies off a bit torrent. However keep in mind that is only going to apply ""nobodies"". Public corporations and public figures are under greater scrutiny. Just because you likely won't get caught doesn't mean a publicly traded company can publicly allow it. It's very similar to how you will not see public companies endorsing piracy.","# ::snt This is just your regular reminder that pornographic loli images are in fact illegal in the USA due to the PROTECT Act of . [LewdGamer's In Depth Essay covering the subject]() [Law Text]() [Wikipedia summary]() [Comic Book Legal Defense Fund Cases]() [US Government Publishing Office PDF archives of cases and appeals]() [More Cases Logged at Wikipedia]() [Example UK Case]() [The Miller test, which is used to deem the work obscene in the USA and thus not protected by the first ammendment and illegal]() [Information on the CPPA, the precursor to the PROTECT act that was struck down in supreme court and why the PROTECT act requires works be deemed obscene to be illegal.]() Common Objections & FAQs >That was ruled unconstitutional in Ashcroft vs. Free Speech Coalition No, that's the CPPA. [See here]() >Parts of the PROTECT Act of were ruled unconstitutional so loli pronography is ok! The law was upheld to be valid as long as the work is deemed [obscene per the miller test]() in both the [Whorley]() and [Handley]() cases. The Handley case did cite that the sections that don't also require the work to be deemed obscene were too overbroad but they also cited that, ""This conclusion has minimal impact on this case given the almost complete redundancy of the conduct criminalized by subsections A(a)(1) and (b)(1) (SIC: The sections requiring obscenity) with that of subsections A(a)(2) and (b)(2) (SIC: The sections not requiring obscenity)."" Other sections have also already [survived a supreme court challenge](). >All the convictions also involve actual child pornography so it doesn't count. [No they aren't all like that.](). You can find some searching the [court archives of them too](). It's important to keep in mind that DA's typically like to charge you with anything they can think of and see what sticks. Being convicted of this law along with other violations doesn't negate the fact that loli pornography, which is going to be deemed obscene, is still illegal all on it's own. Also it's important to realize that prosecutions for this are really rare. It's typically used as a way to add time to a sentence or as a way to get you for something if their original accusations fail in a similar fashion to how Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion. >If prosecutions are so rare than it doesn't matter. It's true the prosecutions are rare, as LewdGamer's essay clearly outlined. It's as likely for a private citizen nobody to get caught solely for this as they are of being caught downloading movies off a bit torrent. However keep in mind that is only going to apply ""nobodies"". Public corporations and public figures are under greater scrutiny. Just because you likely won't get caught doesn't mean a publicly traded company can publicly allow it. It's very similar to how you will not see public companies endorsing piracy.
