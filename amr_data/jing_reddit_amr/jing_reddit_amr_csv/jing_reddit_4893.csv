"Not only do we almost entirely adore Loki, but he is obviously very masculine in the same style/ sense that the joker is. Loki also snaps from being cool and collected to loud and aggressive, hes manipulative, treacherous, playful, rivalrous, damaged, has a great desire for recognition and power, obvious historically masculine things. Part of his whole story is a *brotherly* rivalry for the spotlight. Oh tumblr and their incessant character warping and claiming. And we enjoy them all because theyre charmingly evil and utterly intriguing in their moralities.","# ::snt Not only do we almost entirely adore Loki, but he is obviously very masculine in the same style/ sense that the joker is.
