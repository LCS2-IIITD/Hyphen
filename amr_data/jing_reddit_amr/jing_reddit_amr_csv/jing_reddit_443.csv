"My experience in the Army was that out of female soldiers were shammers, constantly using their sex to get out of work details, or their baby as an excuse to show up late and leave early, or just generally worthless on the job. Every now and then you would meet one who was competent and no bullshit. That's in an office environment. In a field environment, women absolutely are not PHYSICALLY built to handle the rigorous demands of military operations. Even in basic training this was obvious. During a ruck march where we were only carrying lbs in our rucksacks, I watched this foot something female soldier (a tiny little Latina girl) literally doubled over trying to carry her pack and rifle without falling over. I think her gear weighed over half what she did. She ended up falling out of that ruck march and getting picked up by the trail vehicle. A lot of times, women in the military don't do their share of the work, so the men working along side them end up with more work to do. They don't pull their own weight, and that makes them a liability in a combat environment.","# ::snt My experience in the Army was that out of female soldiers were shammers, constantly using their sex to get out of work details, or their baby as an excuse to show up late and leave early, or just generally worthless on the job.
