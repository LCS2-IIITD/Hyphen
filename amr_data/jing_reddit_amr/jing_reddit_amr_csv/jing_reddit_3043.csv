"My dick is basically unusable due to this. The process was agressive and the scar tissue healed in a way that's basically trapped my junk in my pelvise. Because of my reaction as a baby to being cut my parents didn't do it to my brother. When he insisted his son be cut (cause cleaning himself was a bother he stated) I dragged him into a bathroom and dropped my pants. He changed his mind right there. I've talked to several women about this practice and they all come back with the same excuse ""uncut dicks look weird"". Guess how happy I would be if all it was, was ""weird""","# ::snt My dick is basically unusable due to this.
