"Not trying to take agency from people is fair. No matter his shitty choice in partner however, you can still blame her for being a negative influence on his condition. To me it seems that what you are saying is that even mentally ill individuals have to bear all responsibility themselves in every situation, even though they might not be capable of that at that point. Instead of saying "" dont be an asshole towards already vulnerable people"". Not my first language, please disregard mistakes and weird wording.","# ::snt Not trying to take agency from people is fair.
