"The man didnt act near as aggressively as the woman until after the cops yanked him by his throat to the ground. Far as I can tell, thats what immediately escalated this. Which leads me to a serious question: Why are the cops being praised for their restraint? Maybe Im missing something, but the guy is just drunkenly shrugging away from the cops the same way a toddler pulls away from his parent when theyre mad. Why does that lead to such an extreme takedown and wrestling match.","# ::snt The man didnt act near as aggressively as the woman until after the cops yanked him by his throat to the ground.
