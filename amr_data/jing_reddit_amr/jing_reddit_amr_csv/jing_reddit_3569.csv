"Here's the weird thing: Trump is a narcissist through and through. We DID vote for him because Hillary was worse. But the shocking thing is as bad as his foreign policy is, it's actually BETTER than most mainstream politicians prior to it. Seriously. ISIS is on the run. North Korea is more receptive than they've been in decades. We haven't been dragged into any Iraqs or Afghanistans. The economy is fucking excellent. Black unemployment isn't at record lows like they're saying, but it IS extremely low. Trump hasn't expanded or engaged in policies like drone strike assassinations like Obama did, which everyone seems to forget about. He's had possibly the most peaceful presidency is decades. Now don't get me wrong, he's also done a lot of bad things. He's continued to egg on like left(although they're mostly egging on themselves). He's offensive as all fuck. He's fucking with education funding which was the last thing we need right now. And his border policies while an improvement are mired in scandals because even he's not sure how to follow through on this in an ethical way. My point is, we voted for him expecting a metaphorical grenade to throw at the establishment(none of us want actual violence. We just wanted to shake things up). Instead we got a surprisingly decent president in spite of it all. I'll be voting for him again next time around. He's doing a good job. Let's no kid ourselves. What does it say about our establishment that an obvious narcissistic is better than the last presidents? And arguably the Clinton presidency depending on the angle you take.","# ::snt Here's the weird thing: Trump is a narcissist through and through. We DID vote for him because Hillary was worse.
