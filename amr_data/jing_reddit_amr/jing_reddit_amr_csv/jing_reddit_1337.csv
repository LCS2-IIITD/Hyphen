">I don't really believe this was a case of the girl trying to falsely accuse these men. Yeah this was a case of a girl getting drunk, consenting to sex while intoxicated, then waking up and realizing what she has done, regretted it, and told everyone it was rape, and not only that, took them to fucking court. I can see a case being made, if a girl is intentionally given drinks or lead to getting drunk, given shots etc to get as drunk as possible, to then have sex with, that could be rape and would stand in a trial. But getting drunk by yourself, because you want to, and then having sex, and afterwards crying rape, is pure **insanity**.","# ::snt >I don't really believe this was a case of the girl trying to falsely accuse these men.
