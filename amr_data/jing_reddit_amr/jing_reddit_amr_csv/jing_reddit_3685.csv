Lol. It's been fun roll playing with you man.

I would say you're like % believable. You managed to fire off: Soy boy. Umad. Triggered. Which have lost their luster just a little. Once you polish up on your next key phrases you'll really start nailing people! But anyways like I said. It's been fun! I'm about to head out so... Make sure you clean the dust from your PC vents. Wouldn't want your computer to overheat from you being on it all Saturday night slinging rock solid insults at strangers and agrovoting their posts down hahahaha!
