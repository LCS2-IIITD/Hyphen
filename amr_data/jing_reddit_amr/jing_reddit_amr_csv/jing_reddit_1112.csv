"This is exactly why those critics who also complained about no selectable gender for the Persona main character are so short-sighted. Either you dumb down interactions to make no assumptions about gender (which makes no sense for a series much about high school social life), or you put in all the extra work to craft alternate dialogue and scenes for the opposite gender (at which point you might as well be adding more for a sole gender that all players will see). Western RPGs like those from Bioware and Bethesda get away with selectable gender because their main characters are purposefully basic as player avatars with all of the personality gets put into other characters met along the way. But this has never been the case before for Assassin's Creed games in which main characters are written with specific personality and relations that make them different from each other.","# ::snt This is exactly why those critics who also complained about no selectable gender for the Persona main character are so short-sighted.
