"No, though there are some good NDs out there i think most of them kind of get hooked to something of a MLM style doctoring and dont do proper blood work and look at functional ranges. Youll see many of them running only a TSH just as many MDs do but never get T3 or T4 or reverse T3, again like many MDs, so they miss primary and tertiary thyroid issues. Dont get me wrong each type of doctor has their place and there are some great NDs but the person makes the doctor not the letters. Btw in an internist, I deal with blood work and histories.
