"What I don't understand about this is how can certain publishers legally operate in the US when they localize explicitly loli content? MangaGamer has released several visual novels with clearly underage characters in sexual situations (uncensored I might add) and they have no issue selling those products in the red states. In fact, one of the few times they actually censored something was bestiality-related as that's apparently riskier to bring over, and this was in a VN that had loli incest completely intact.","# ::snt What I don't understand about this is how can certain publishers legally operate in the US when they localize explicitly loli content?

"Huh, could have swore pot wasn't illegal on a federal level anymore and it's just that most states still have it on the books. I figured it was like fireworks, where they're illegal to own in my state, but you can just buy them in the next state over.

And correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't places that sell pot in California smaller places and not these big conglomerates? Not that niche publishers are big conglomerates either, but they're still paying federal taxes and get more spread out coverage for their products.","# ::snt Huh, could have swore pot wasn't illegal on a federal level anymore and it's just that most states still have it on the books.
