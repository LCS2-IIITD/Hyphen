"The moment the lunatic fringe give a cause the sacred cow treatment, the blowback starts. Supporting LGBT shit should be as simple as thinking being gay should have no bearing on the freedoms given to you from birth. Not LGBT related, but there was an old Magic: The Gathering article on StarCityGames.com, where the author dared suggest we treat women players the same as any other player of Magic -- that article was pulled and an apology was offered by the head editor. So yes -- if even the notion of equal treatment is considered ""not good enough"", perhaps that blowback IS warranted.","# ::snt The moment the lunatic fringe give a cause the sacred cow treatment, the blowback starts.
