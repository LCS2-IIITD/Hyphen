"Actually I was thinking of the one who has **admitted** that she lied. I don't find the one you are referring to any more credible than the woman who has come clean about her lies, but we can't prove she was lying. But as you noted, we've seen that Miss Vocal Fry has received a great deal for her unfounded and unverified accusations. A **lot** of money. Hero worship by the regressives.","# ::snt Actually I was thinking of the one who has **admitted** that she lied.
