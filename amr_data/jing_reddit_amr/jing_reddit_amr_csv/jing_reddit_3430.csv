"Lol that wouldn't end well. Whites pretty much run the world. The genocide would last minutes if that before anyone getting stroppy got slapped back into the stone age. (If you think I'm joking remember this. Britain, a tiny country by most standards (78th largest) subjugated about a THIRD OF THE GLOBE...) If its a day when the Japanese and Chinese are white as well shorten that to minutes. Have a nice day","# ::snt Lol that wouldn't end well. Whites pretty much run the world.
