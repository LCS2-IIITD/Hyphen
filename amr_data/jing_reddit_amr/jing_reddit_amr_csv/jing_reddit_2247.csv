"I came here to voice this same sentiment. When I first subbed here, I saw posts that were against things like women falsely accusing men of rape or women not getting the same length of punishment as men for sex crimes. I'm all about that kind of stuff. I'm not anti-feminism though and the longer I've stayed here, the more toxic posts I've seen. Don't think I'll be subbed for much longer tbh as I am not going to be part of a hate subreddit.","# ::snt I came here to voice this same sentiment.
