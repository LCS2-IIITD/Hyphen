"You also have to think about the current political climate and the way it might come across to people who don't know you very well. I've got a friend who dyes their hair all kinds of colors. They get assumed to be a modern feminist all the time, but they don't follow that mindset at all. It sucks, I know. But stuff like that does happen just based on the current political climate.","# ::snt You also have to think about the current political climate and the way it might come across to people who don't know you very well.
