"Are you sure you ain't eats Indian? Cause I saw that shit happen,when one of my cousins were having an arranged marriage. The dude turned out to be a docuhebag but money tho.. My enlightenment of this was, when my dad retired in . My mom treated him like shit for trying to relax and prior to that, she expected him to do everything for her family. Like buy phones,ipods,etc to take with her when she visited her family. She didnt do that with his family. At that moment I knew nothing if MGTOW but I knew I would never marry or be in a relationship if that what comes out of it.","# ::snt Are you sure you ain't eats Indian?

"well I have brown skin and I am a shit singer on the shower but I prefer chile spicy over spice spicy so no, completely sure not an indian although I agree the culture of nailing husbands to the wall is similar. On the case above the guys resulted to be actually decent and likeable, but they are still poor. i never went MGTOW in the sense its a relatively new term to me. I simply decided out of my own to focus on myself rather than waste money on girls and dating. When I actually went on dates I had some rules I religiously followed. - Make sure you can have fun alone on the date if she doesnt show up or simply dont like each other. For example watch a movie you will like regardless if you are with company. - Think how much you would spend alone, if the date goes well you can increase the amount but only if she agrees to be the one paying the second time. - Kisses and sex early, if she wants to wait for whatever reason its ok, dont push it. The best way to not push it is to stop dating. - Make sure she knows you dont want an stable relationship in a natural way. she will bring the subject 'casually' so just answer equally 'casually'. - Spend at least the same time and money on fun as you spend improving yourself, fun includes fun alone and dating. I have many good stories to tell on how I learned and applied each lesson, maybe will sometime. I dont date anymore because I am living with a girl who doesnt want to get married and knows I will literally flee the country if she tries to nail me. She also has an extreme case of tokophobia and she would literally gag if she sees a pregnant woman so pregnancy is less likely. I am more afraid of the girls at work to be honest, I know some of them hate me for being an insuferable asshole in charge of making sure they dont mess up code. I have adopted personal policies of only calling their attention on bad code when my boss is present, never mentor them alone and only talk to them through corporate email.","# ::snt well I have brown skin and I am a shit singer on the shower but I prefer chile spicy over spice spicy so no, completely sure not an indian although I agree the culture of nailing husbands to the wall is similar.

"> the idea of men running of of marriage (cum and run) are more common than not marrying at all, so not sure how MGTOW will affect us. in rural small towns in india or mexico its literally impossible to scape. in rural small towns its either go solo o get nailed.

There is only backfiring weaponized babies. On today society women have options on every step of the way to not be mothers, simply they use kids as hammers to nail guys and sometimes it doesnt work.
