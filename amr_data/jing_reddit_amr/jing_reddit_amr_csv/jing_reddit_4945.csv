">>This is how after being a tabletop gamer for + years, Id never finished a game of Dungeons and Dragons. I said that to a new friend, a biracial tech in my office who well call MJ, and he was floored. His answer? You havent played *my* game yet. MJ dared me to try again. This is someone who has never played D&D. You don't finish D&D, you never 'finish' anything, you complete a story arch and you can literally play the same damn PC FOREVER. Perhaps complete a campaign? Is that what we are referring to here? Either way it matters that MJ needs to be biracial because of course that matters here. Race matters to whom you play with. It soooo matters to who runs the game because who wants an icky gross WHITE CIGGENDERED MAN(!?) to run the story! That's all levels of problematic /s >>Together, MJ and I collected some other people of color who were interested in giving D&D another chance, along with a single white guy to balance things out. Christ this is disgusting to read this. Balance things out? Why does the person playing the game's RACE matter to people playing an escapist fantasy game?!?!? EDIT: to clarify which race i'm talking about because being a gnome barbarian is much different than playing as a dwarf...dwarves are betterer of course.","# ::snt >>This is how after being a tabletop gamer for + years, Id never finished a game of Dungeons and Dragons.
