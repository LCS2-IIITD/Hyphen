"Oh I agree, I think everybody is fucking daring them to do it, but they want people to be on side with the legislation which is why they're being cautious. For example with the way they're trying to make 'misogyny' a hate crime, they want people to just vote for it blindly and then that's when they'll get everybody. However people caught on to what they were planning it seems and they're trying to make Misandry into a hate crime law as well lol.","# ::snt Oh I agree, I think everybody is fucking daring them to do it, but they want people to be on side with the legislation which is why they're being cautious.
