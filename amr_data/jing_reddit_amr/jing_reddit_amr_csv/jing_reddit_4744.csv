"I understand your sentiment. However, lets be real, you can be safe, or you can be sorry. This guy didn't choose safe. I'm not blaming him for what happened, but he probably pushed his way through this group thinking he was tough enough to handle anything. However he didn't count on being **sucker punched** which I guarantee is what happened, he tried to move past, got sucker punched and now he's retarded. So what does his intentions matter now? What do his principles or whether he's in the right or not matter now? He's basically dead. Be safe out there.","# ::snt I understand your sentiment.
