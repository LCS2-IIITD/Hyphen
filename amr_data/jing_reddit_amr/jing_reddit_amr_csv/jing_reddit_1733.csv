"> You enforced certain rules at will and with varying propriety all depending on your own political and social opinions You know how I know you never stopped to actually *ask* what my opinions were on politics/social shit? I'm extremely pro-2A, not very tranny-friendly, believe all religions should lose tax exempt status, am for completely dismantling the welfare state, *still* think the ACA is unconstitutional, am convinced too many people on *all* sides spend far too much time getting asspained over other people daring to disagree with *what is clearly the only right way to groupthink*, and laugh to no end at people *like you* who can't take five fucking minutes to look beyond what you *want* to see to justify your own delusional vision of how the world should bend to match *your* ""ideal alternate reality"". So keep jerking yourself raw in the corner, hoping a few more butthurt people who had their totally-vital-for-the-universe-to-see posts removed for not actually having anything to do with KiA, all in the hopes that you can get a premade audience to try to co-opt for whatever your flavor-of-the-week self-righteous cause is.","# ::snt > You enforced certain rules at will and with varying propriety all depending on your own political and social opinions You know how I know you never stopped to actually *ask* what my opinions were on politics/social shit?
