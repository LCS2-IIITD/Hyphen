"My assumption is that you haven't been around many females so I will attempt to explain this statement for you. A common misconception amongst children is that the term ""girlfriend"" denotes some sort of romantic entanglement. This may be true when uttered by heterosexual men, but many females and homosexuals refer to other females or homosexuals as ""girlfriend"". When ""girlfriend"" is used by females or homosexuals it is almost always in reference to friendship. This is a common practice amongst females and homosexuals. I understand how you may have been confused, this confusion may be due to lack of female contact or the willingness of the opposite sex to interact with you.
