"Resisting arrest is illegal. Aswell as ""You white piece of shit"" and ""You're not allowed to beat me like that, I'm a woman"" at :52 aswell as fighting back and spitting at officers. I'd argue that she more than deserved it. She did something illegal, then resisted arrest AND screeched like she's getting fucking stabbed or something while attacking the police. You try putting cuffs on a ""little woman*"" that shakes around and screeches like that. You don't get anywhere without force.","# ::snt Resisting arrest is illegal.

"You can actually murder the cop if he is illegally arresting you. You'll need loads of proof that you were innocent of the crime that he was arresting you for, but yeah, unlawful arrest is hella illegal and there are a lot of legal precedents where people legally killed cops that were illegally arresting them. A lot of people have a deep-seeded love affair with cops though, so they'll tell you that you *have to* comply with any order that a cop ever makes of you. Those people are wrong. You can not only fight off a cop that is illegally arresting you, you can murder a cop that is illegally arresting someone else too. That is what the US Supreme Court has ruled. In your specific example about being confused with a burglar, however, it would probably be ruled these days that the cops had ""reasonable suspicion"" to arrest you; which is basically a catch-all for any and all behavior that a cop wants to do. So the real question is: how much of the law will a cop/judge bend in order to protect themselves in the event of an unlawful arrest? The answer is: a lot. A lot of the law will be bent and even broken in order to protect a cop that commits an unlawful arrest, so you therefore would likely not be able to exercise your *right* to defend yourself from cops. Kinda scary. There are a plenty of cases though, even recently, where people are found innocent of murdering an unlawful cop... but most of those people still spent time in jail, and were even badly beaten by other police (see the Ray Rosas case), so you'll probably still miss your flight... but there was a guy that killed a cop in self defense then evaded other cops for days and was still found not guilty, so who knows, you might be able to catch that flight after all. It's a very imperfect system, and anyone that you find defending it is usually incompetently ignorant of it and has a Just-World Fallacy and thinks that all cops are good guys and they only ever catch bad guys... or they are a cop themselves, and they benefit greatly from this fascist shit show.","# ::snt You can actually murder the cop if he is illegally arresting you.
