"Guns need to be banned because people don't know how to use these tools of defence in a responsible manner.

Leftists have told me that we cannot trust the government because the gobernment is gorrupted. And these law enforcement groups work for the government. What are we to do? Oh shit a guy is pulling out a firearm at us. He still needs seconds to maul us all down... I'm sure the police are going fling in like supermen and save us all. In all seriousness, don't go for gun control. Your neighbouring country Mexico have gun control laws. The population got disarmed and yet in the end the cartel disarmed their government.
