"> On reddit, far too often when I warn peope to not simply accept working + hours on a h a week contract, they get very defensive and claim everyone else is lazy. The h/week standard is that way for a good reason. You need a healthy work-life balance. Also the flame that shines twice as bright burns half as long... And no worker can buy more lifetime back for the money earned.","# ::snt > On reddit, far too often when I warn peope to not simply accept working + hours on a h a week contract, they get very defensive and claim everyone else is lazy.
