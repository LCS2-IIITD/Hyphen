">""Entitled Gamers"" &; That's a weird phrase to have come up in this whole thing. I mean, I think the entire thing from every side stinks of being a PR stunt to raise the profile of an aging game that didn't perform to expectations and damaged the reputation of the franchise and developer. But I mean, if you've purchased and used a product, you are actually entitled to review that product and give your opinion, even if you're a dipshit, even if your opinion sucks and even if the basis for your opinion is wrong. You're especially entitled to that if the product is being changed well after you've already paid for it. &;","# ::snt >""Entitled Gamers"" &; That's a weird phrase to have come up in this whole thing.
