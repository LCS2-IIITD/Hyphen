"This is the most evil thing I've seen on this sub. And all those losers are smiling in the back like it's so cool what she is doing. This disgusting woman put this guy in a complete no-win situation. If he says yes, then everyone will think he's some wimpy-ass loser who didn't have the balls to ask her to marry like a real man would. Everyone will KNOW who wears the pants in that relationship. Or they will think that he didn't have the balls to say No, so he's doubly fucked if he says Yes. And if he says No, everyone will think about all the trouble the girl went thru and feel sorry for her and think the guy's a royal dickhead. He looks in reasonable shape and should be able to out-run that cow of a woman.","# ::snt This is the most evil thing I've seen on this sub.
