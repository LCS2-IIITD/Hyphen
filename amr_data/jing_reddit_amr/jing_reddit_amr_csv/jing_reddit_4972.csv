>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this report wrongly described the rape allegation made against Jay Cheshire as false. In fact it was simply withdrawn. We apologise for the error. From the article linked. That means that it wasn't a false accusation of rape. (which is a crime) just that the girl decided not to pursue. This happens for many rape victims as the trial can be very exhausting and often they would rather just move on with their life rather then go though a lengthy court process.,"# ::snt >CORRECTION: An earlier version of this report wrongly described the rape allegation made against Jay Cheshire as false.
