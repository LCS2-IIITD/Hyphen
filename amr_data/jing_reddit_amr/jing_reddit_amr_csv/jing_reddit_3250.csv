"Lol Im interested in having children of my own, I wouldnt be with someone who cant have our children for a reason like them being trans. What happened to people simply not wanting to have sex with some people? If someone doesnt have sex with me, a white male simply because Im a white male I wouldnt accuse them of being sexist or racist by any means. Yall need to get over yourselves. Pre edit before anyone asks or says anything: I would be with a woman if she couldnt have our children for medical reasons other than the place Im sticking my dick is where their dick used to be. Im also an advocate of adoption for those who cannot have children. All good with those reasons.","# ::snt Lol Im interested in having children of my own, I wouldnt be with someone who cant have our children for a reason like them being trans.
