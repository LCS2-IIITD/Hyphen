"I'm so sick of this big brother shit. I mean... He is black. Right? Pretty low on the totem pole of what's out there for black African descent. I had a gay friend who was so drunk and a gay bouncer raised the price to get into a gay club by double. On new year's... We only left for ten minutes! My gay friend's response as we walked away? ""WHATEVER NIGGER!"" I found it funny. Still do. Laughed while typing it. Find it funny on so many levels. Def don't think dude is a racist. When you're drunk and yelling at someone, you're just trying to hurl whatever you can to hurt their feelings. I'm so sick of people getting hung up on what the drunk person said while not acknowledging that it's a natural side-effect of being super drunk and super angry.","# ::snt I'm so sick of this big brother shit.
