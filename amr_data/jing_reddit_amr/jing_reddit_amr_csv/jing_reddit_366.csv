"A lot of it is just wanting to nip it in the bud with a settlement and people know that. There was this woman who worked the front desk at a police department and the men would read like sports illustrated and maxim in the break room. She sued and got like k. Said she didn't feel comfortable in the environment. Thing is, she never complained so no one at work knew it was an issue. Not the chain of command or people in charge. Judge didn't ask about that though.","# ::snt A lot of it is just wanting to nip it in the bud with a settlement and people know that.
