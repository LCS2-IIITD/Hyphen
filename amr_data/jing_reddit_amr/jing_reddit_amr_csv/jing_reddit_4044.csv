"Honestly, I don't get why everyone even bothers trying to placate SJWs. They will inevitably turn on you because you aren't black, or aren't genderfluid, or aren't mentally disabled, or your skin isn't dark enough... eventually someone more oppressed will come along and then you'll get labelled a shitlord and they'll turn against you. The biggest thing for me is that SJWs don't really seem to consume media either. They talk about it, but they don't seem to actually pay for it, which makes courting them pointless. Who cares what those twats think about Marvel or Overwatch if they aren't bringing any money to the franchise? Why not focus on making a better product.","# ::snt Honestly, I don't get why everyone even bothers trying to placate SJWs.
