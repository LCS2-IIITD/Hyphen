"> Now I can't play RDR2. Yes you can, and you won't have to pay an arm and a leg to do so. Not a single western AAA release ever holds its value. RDR2 will cost five bucks used in two years, ten new, and the announcement of the PS5 will mean you can scoop both new and used consoles dirt fucking cheap. Keep PCMR for your current games, man, and don't worry about keeping up with the Joneses. If a game comes out on console and you *really* have to have it, wait... just wait. The prices will go down, you can scoop those and have those experiences too.","# ::snt > Now I can't play RDR2. Yes you can, and you won't have to pay an arm and a leg to do so.
