"It's not even just this once instance... she's always irritating. The other day the teacher mentioned the words ''sugar daddy'' as an example to some business concept (where the person doesn't do anything but still has power in the company) and she was the **only** girl in that class who giggled. Loudly. She tries to be that cute, funny, popular girl but falls flat on her face. Very superficial. I remember at the very start, I saw her at the train station I go to after school. So I talked to her a few times. Eventually, I decided to walk with her since we had our last class together that day. She began pulling her headphones out of her pocked and untangling them. I thought it was a bit odd, but whatever. She plugs them into her ears, starts making a call as she's walking with me, without saying anything. I thought okay, maybe it won't last long. Oh, how wrong I was. She just kept talking and talking. Eventually walking faster and faster, and went to a different part of the station. Haven't talked to the bitch since, nor do I ever intend to, again.","# ::snt It's not even just this once instance... she's always irritating.
