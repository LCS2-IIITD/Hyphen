"Meanwhile, I just saw a thread on chan about how the game does too much to distance itself from white supremacist themes and injects too much Social Justice in... Just goes to show, you really just can't win. So far, I've really enjoyed the game, for what it's worth. While some of the writing may be a bit too ""careful,"" the acting is great. The action is immersive.
