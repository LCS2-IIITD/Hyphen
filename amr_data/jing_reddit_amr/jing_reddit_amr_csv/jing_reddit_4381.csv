"I honestly can't understand this from a Mensrights point of view. I'm all for mens rights, but I'm also for being a Gentleman. I'll /10 times give my coat. Now I'd be upset if my Girl expected me to do it and didn't appreciate it, which she doesn't and neither does this lady here seem to expect. But the people that expect it and shame him are just as stupid. Those People don't seem to be the focus here though and it seems people here genuinely think what kanye is doing is fine.
