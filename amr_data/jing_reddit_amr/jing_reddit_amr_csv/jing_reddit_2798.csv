This was posted not so long ago. Im sure I remember people being worried for her welfare as the video showed the man was being very controlling. It's possible she was being encouraged to do these things for followers and views online and the guys were probs making a shit ton of money off her. It seems odd she would agree to do this knowing she would fail.,"# ::snt This was posted not so long ago.
