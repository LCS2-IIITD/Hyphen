"For those who don't think this is significant or worth noting it worth being mad about: The Killstresm was the number one viewed live late night talk show on YouTube. This is the YouTube equivalent of firing Conan O'Brien or Jay Leno at the height of their shows. ""Oh but their audience is edgy preteens"" Yeah no, their fan call ins were all adults to my knowledge. But even if that were true, censoring the children's entertainment isn't just wrong, it's pathetic. This isn't just YouTube taking down a channel. This is YouTube proving that on their platform no audience is large enough that you can't get fucked over.","# ::snt For those who don't think this is significant or worth noting it worth being mad about: The Killstresm was the number one viewed live late night talk show on YouTube.
