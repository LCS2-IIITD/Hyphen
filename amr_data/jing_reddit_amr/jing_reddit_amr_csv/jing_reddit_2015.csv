"It's a concert. People kiss at concerts and if that bothers you, stay home and have fun by yourself. The women did not even kiss anyway so you obviously didn't even read the article and made an assumption. They were even kind enough to offer free tickets to the homophobic woman as well. You need to learn how to live with other people without getting upset over every little thing like something as harmless as a kiss. Grow up.","# ::snt It's a concert.
