"Sadly it's one of the core values of the DemonkkkRats or leftism in general: mob rule. Using the power of the group to intimidate and bully for consensus. It speaks to those whom don't want to be left out of the group and is quite a study of the political science classes as a means of manipulation. They are simply trying to give the false impression that Presisent Trump has no supporters, which in turn makes the free thinkers who flock to rightwing ideolgies dig in deeper as well. Here's hoping your butt cancer goes to the way of the dying DemonkkkRat party that needs to import foreign voters that believe in siezing the means of production!","# ::snt Sadly it's one of the core values of the DemonkkkRats or leftism in general: mob rule.
