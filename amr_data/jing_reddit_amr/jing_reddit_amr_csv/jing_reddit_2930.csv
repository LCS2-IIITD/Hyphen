"Bro, you need to calm the fuck down. I never said I'd let a woman talk over me, especially if she's being disrespectful. Just because some of them are ignorant of men's issues doen't mean that we should treat them, or all women, as subordinates. We should seek to educate them in a respectful manner. That would reflect well on the MRA group, and be better for everyone. Ironically, your comment was the most NPC thing I've read today. How cliche.","# ::snt Bro, you need to calm the fuck down.
