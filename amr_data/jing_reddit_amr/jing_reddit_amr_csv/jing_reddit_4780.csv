"This video is absolutely amazing. Though, i am not sure it qualifies as PPD. The first girl did admit that ""men are victims too."" I highly doubt she believes such after witnessing her hysterical radicalism. However, the upvotes clearly demonstrate the sub's approval, so it will stay. I will say this though, Steven Crowder absolutely demolishes this ultra-fragile, cotton ball-coddled, servile authoritarian crybully at :50. In order to enjoy her takedown all the more, i suggest you watch the whole minutes leading up. Her smugness (""**for the record, this man does not know who Brett Kavanaugh is!!!!!!**"") and arrogance over the fact that she think shes more in the know than he gets shut down so fast when he unleashes a tirade of facts to her wide eyes and awestruck face. ""Do you know what hubris is?"" he says right before laying down the Holy of Holies on her ass. God i hope she becomes famous. Holy shit. Say what you will about the guy, his climate change stuff and all that, but he reduces her pathetic ass to tears by not raising his voice at all and only calmly talking numbers and data. It was an amazing moment. There is a moment of utter silence and disbelief following the thrashing. Nobody is able to counter, so what do they do after picking their jaws off the ground? they say shit like ""dude...no.."" and call for campus police. obviously the police are needed because there was definitely a motherfucking murder. buh gawd. Crowder tore through these mush minds so brutally that the school had to send out an apology tweet virtue signalling their disgust for crowder the next day where they had to plug in a guidance counselor. balls almighty.","# ::snt This video is absolutely amazing.
