"As a professional Software Developer in the industry for years, i've yet to meet a female Developer of any value. The majority of them spend the day on social media and gossiping, the others ask the men around them to do their work, and the others do the most basic ""coding"" like editing HTML and CSS tags to change the font and colour on text. My conclusion: don't worry, the app they build will be a pile of shit.","# ::snt As a professional Software Developer in the industry for years, i've yet to meet a female Developer of any value.

"I've mentored a few women, didn't go down well either.

When I started out I was I guess quite left liberal leaning, very optimistic about doing my bit to smash the patriarchy (I actually believed the wage gap was real). Then I started working with Female Developers. I noticed they were always either complaining, gossiping, wasting company time on social media, or asking someone else to do their work. Ok I thought, so maybe I just happened to be put with some bad examples, but all other women developers will be amazing hot shot genius coders... but the same patter was observed at EVERY single IT company I ever worked at. I guess it was an awakening moment, where I realized ""oh shit i've been lied too, women can't code and hate being at work"". Today, I treat women Developers the same way as children. If they ask for help i'll provide it, if I have to work on a project with them i'll do my best, but I have absolutely no expectations from them whatsover and refuse to be surprised when another one is escorted out the building for being completely utterly incompetent.","# ::snt I've mentored a few women, didn't go down well either.
