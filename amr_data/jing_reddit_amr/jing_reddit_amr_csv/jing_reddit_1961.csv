"> why should free speech protect Nazis advocating genocide? Except it doesn't. It's illegal to incite violence and it's not protected under free speech. The problem is, you believe that anyone who disagrees with you is a Nazi and are expanding the definition of violence so broadly so you can say that someone saying something you don't like is ""violence"". That's what people are not agreeing with, not that calling for a group's death should be legal.","# ::snt > why should free speech protect Nazis advocating genocide? Except it doesn't.
