"We are super bad at this whole opression and supremacy bit, I mean, if white people are such an evil empire, our subjects are allowed an awful lot of freedom to contradict us and work actively to thwart our rule. I often wonder what these people would do if the world was actually the way they think it is. Fighting percieved evil regimes is easy when there are no consequences. I would bet even money they would buckle and fall in line meekely if opposite were true. These are people who are triggered into full on panic attacks by clapping and other such nonsense.","# ::snt We are super bad at this whole opression and supremacy bit, I mean, if white people are such an evil empire, our subjects are allowed an awful lot of freedom to contradict us and work actively to thwart our rule.
