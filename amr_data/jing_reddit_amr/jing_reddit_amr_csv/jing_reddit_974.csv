"> That sort of one sided characterization really pulled me out of the story and spoke of agenda. It's not just male/female either. Every antagonist is white except for who both betray the empire for the good guys(aka, they're actually protagonists). In rogue one they even made the deliberate casting choice to have zero white male protagonists. They're hamfisting in a weird kind of racial politics into it as well.","# ::snt > That sort of one sided characterization really pulled me out of the story and spoke of agenda.
