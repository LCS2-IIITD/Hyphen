"There's plenty of fucked up people in all manner of the adult art community, the problem is people like to think their fetish has no bad actors involved and just cause some people are weirdos doesn't mean they're dangerous. I once argued with a furry artist that the argument against furry art is the same as their argument against lolicon. They both have the same potential pitfalls of bad actors (as do other fetishes). This person even gave ""cubs"" a pass as not the same thing or a gray area. But there's furry's that are genuinely into beastiality, and fans of loli art and anime that are genuinely pedo. These people are rare and in the minority but they exist, attempting to deny that is the problem. Not your fetish that merely exists in fantasy and generally far from realism in it's depiction.
