"This is weirdly specific, but I've always hated the word ""lesbian."" I think it's because it's a noun, and immediately has the same connotation as something like ""one of the gays,"" ""fag,"" ""dyke,"" etc. People resort to nouns when they're being derogatory, because it places ""those people"" over into another category. As opposed to when it's just one detail about them as a person. Adjectives are more likely to be innocent or unassuming. ""Oh, she's gay? Had no idea.
