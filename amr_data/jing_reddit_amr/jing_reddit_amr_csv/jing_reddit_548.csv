You talk complete nonsense. Do you deserve to fall down just because you sawed off the branch you were sitting on? Do you consider it being some evil plot that you expect someone to save you from? The gal purposefully works to make Finland into a diverse country. Diverse countries tend to have very high violent crime rate including sexual crimes. What exactly is wrong in implying that she should lie in the bed she is actively making? How exactly are my words or opinion even make it into being a punishable offense?,"# ::snt You talk complete nonsense.
