"And the main reason this movement will hurt women its not because men are afraid of being exposed for sexual harassment, but rather that the movement never differentiated between actual sexual harassment/assault and minor situations (e.g., woman was asked out, she declined, and nothing more happened). Since any woman could claim without explaining what actually happened but still getting the benefit of sympathy from society, just about every woman claimed . People started to realize that the problem was not necessarily pervasive, but that there was no actual definition for what constitutes an assault or harassment.","# ::snt And the main reason this movement will hurt women its not because men are afraid of being exposed for sexual harassment, but rather that the movement never differentiated between actual sexual harassment/assault and minor situations (e.g., woman was asked out, she declined, and nothing more happened).
