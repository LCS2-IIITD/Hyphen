"Pics or it didn't happen. Seriously though my ex who pushed me into full mgtow didn't want her breasts touched. I thought it was very selfish of her which was pretty much her MO anyways. His reaction before he left tells me he really felt bad about what he had done. Seems like an honest mistake to me. Just like a woman, she can't talk to him right away so she calls the police to white knight her hamstered trauma away.","# ::snt Pics or it didn't happen.
