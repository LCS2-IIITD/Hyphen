comment,amr
I was drawing a comic a few months back and had to draw a Muslim girl whos a lesbian with a black transvestite scientist (note: nobody else in this comic was straight). I just drew a Muslim with her headscarf down and black man in a dress tbh. When it was said by the writer that the Muslim should have her burka on I just said Theres no way that a practicing Muslim would be lesbian without getting pelted to death Note: I didnt choose this writer/story. I was assigned them by the editor,"# ::snt I was drawing a comic a few months back and had to draw a Muslim girl whos a lesbian with a black transvestite scientist (note: nobody else in this comic was straight).
