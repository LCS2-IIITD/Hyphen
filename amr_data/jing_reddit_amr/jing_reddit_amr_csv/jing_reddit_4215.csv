I feel bad here. She was being kicked out of her home and with all that going on she freaked out and kicked and officer trying to pull her away. Whole life seemed falling to pieces so she tried to salvage some of it with a lie. Edit: Being ostracized for holding an opinion on this sub is disappointing. If Im not a women hater I get downvotes!? Seriously? Hope everyone here still loves their mom.,"# ::snt I feel bad here.
