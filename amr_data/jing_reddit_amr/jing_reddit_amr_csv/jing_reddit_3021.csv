"He's not gonna lose actually. He did sign away his rights by the contract, however there's a document in EU, which Poland also signed, that covers remuneration of authors and performers. [Source](). It's a PDF document, although has no label as such, so if you try to open it with Adobe it should be viewable. So, continuing the argument, if you were to look in the document provided via the link above, pdf page (page in the document layout), you can find this quote: > Other countries, such as Poland, do not expressly state that the best-seller clause is limited to cases where rights have been transferred in exchange for a lump sum. Art of the Polish act states that In the event of a gross discrepancy between the remuneration of the author and the benefits of the acquirer of author's economic rights or the licensee, the author may request that the court should duly increase his remuneration. Which according to Article of the Polish Act, makes a rather solid case for Witcher's orignal writer. Not only will he have a case, he has a very specific article in Polish act that covers his exact situation, so he's likely to win that even. I'm obviously not endorsing what he's done, just stating facts. Edit: As people rightfully point out, it all depends on when the contract was signed, so if it was a long while ago, before the law I've referenced went into effect, then the contract would be valid and law wouldn't be applied retroactively. However, I do not possess specifics to make a definite statement. We shall see the court result.","# ::snt He's not gonna lose actually.

"It's a very specific case when an author, presumably a weaker party in a negotiation from the point of law, does not understand the actual value of one's creation and signs away one's rights to said creation for pennies. I could see how this is protection from predatory behaviour of companies that purchase the rights, which definitely happens. You have sides to a negotiation - one is a company with millions at its disposal, another one is an author, not particularly rich usually and hence without access to quality lawers. So the rationale is to give the author an opportunity to benefit from one's work in case one has been pressured into selling it away. If you think that companies actually negotiate fairly, you're severy mistaken. They'll use all the tricks to squeeze every penny out of a deal. Might not be the case here, though, since it'd appear CDPR tried their best to be reasonable and offer compensation which has been declined further, so let's see how it goes.","# ::snt It's a very specific case when an author, presumably a weaker party in a negotiation from the point of law, does not understand the actual value of one's creation and signs away one's rights to said creation for pennies.

Because that opens doors to pressuring smaller parties into unfavorable deals. There's something to be said for against and for that rule. It's the accusers task to actually show how big the discrepancy is. Which would also be based on the risk/reward of the project. IF he wins the case he will pretty much end up with a massively lower amount than if he actually took the deal where he got a % of sales.,"# ::snt Because that opens doors to pressuring smaller parties into unfavorable deals.
