"I always kind of assumed this, and am glad I saw this statistic posted last week. I cant stand being hit by anyone, especially if theyre smaller than me and doing it because I wont do anything back. With that being said, Id like a statistic on harm done. Ive had multiple women hit me over the years and no one has come close to hurting me a little. punch from me and it wouldve been hospital for them. Im all about equality and think anyone trying to physically harm you should be put in their place, but that statistic makes it sound like men a physically abused, but lets be real, its rare a woman can actually hurt us physically. I just think punishments for men hitting a woman back should be non existent. Regardless of damage. Someone tries to hurt you, you defend yourself.","# ::snt I always kind of assumed this, and am glad I saw this statistic posted last week.

"None taken. I wasnt even in the real of having cheated, btw. I just make it very clear from the gate what my stance is on men hitting women, and I guess mistakenly made it clear that they cant hurt me if they tried, and I wouldnt care unless they hit my face. Either way. Most of my close friends, if not all, have been hit by at least girlfriend. Thats why theres a statistic supporting that theres more physical abuse towards men than women in relationships. I just dont compare the two because I doubt many women could hurt a man unless you decide to allow it. Still should be punished equally, though.","# ::snt None taken.
