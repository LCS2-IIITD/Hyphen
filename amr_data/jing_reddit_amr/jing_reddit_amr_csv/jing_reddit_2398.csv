">Is there a way we can shut SJWs down altogether? SJW's are not the source of the problem, they are a symptom of much larger issues facing modern societies. How do you beat them? You can't directly, because again they are not the source. All you can do is to wait for them to die out, literally. Birthrates have not been at replacement level since the 's, the demographics of the world are changing rapidly and new powers are rising. Liberal / progressive societies are literally going extinct. Look at how incredibly different societies were just years ago: fascism, communism, world wars, genocide, mass starvation.. Now imagine what the world looks like years from today. By then the West would be less than % of the world population, the Chinese or some other power will dominate the global politics and dictate terms. Anyone with a functioning brain knows that the long era of liberalism is finally coming to an end, progressivism/SJW's are just the final gasp before it goes under for good. The death of Western liberalism is inevitable, and it's decline is rapidly accelerating (most recent example: Brazil)","# ::snt >Is there a way we can shut SJWs down altogether?
