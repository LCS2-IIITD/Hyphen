"I didn't say they're automatically right.. I said that they're right in this situation. The message of The Little Mermaid is quite literally to give up absolutely everything that you are in order to find ""the perfect man"". Ironically the original fairytale had the exact opposite message, to learn to be comfortable with who you are instead of relying on other people to make you happy. Cinderella was again about how you aren't worthy until you change your appearance and demeanor. What's funny is something like Aladdin which was a gender swap of the same premise, ultimately ended with the message being not to lie, but instead to be yourself. Beauty and the Beast was about legit stockholme syndrome. Fall in love with abusive assholes just because it's better than being single. The hardworking Gaston is considered an ass for all of his negative traits, the Beast, whose accomplishments are a result of birth-rite, does all of the exact same negative shit, but he's considered a good guy. What shocks me is feminists who don't spot these glaring problems, but instead blindly support Disney. ""The Force is Female"" is a marketing slogan, not a philosophy. And where did you get your ""ACTUAL"" feminists? You're talking about extremists. Extremists are never a good thing and are almost always a minority. For every Andrea Dworkin there are non-vocal, even-tempered feminists. For every Roosh-V there are normal non-sexist MRAs.","# ::snt I didn't say they're automatically right..

"How many stories are about men giving up everything and risking it all for being with the perfect woman, protecting her, caring about her, etc.? I'm not saying it should be the rule of law, but for many people that's how they want to be and how they are. Now you will say because muh society, but it has always been that way. You don't have to like it. But if you deny that risking everything for love is something people do, then you are being disingenuous. With Cinderella you should also consider that the prince loved her even when he found out what she really was. Like you can't ignore the fact they had no chance at meeting otherwise. Aladdin is completely different, though. He literally created a whole, complex lie with stories made up of his deeds. Like there is a whole song of the Genie going around and saying outright lies about him. He created a whole new persona, while Cinderella just went to the ball. Belle only started liking the Beast once he started being nicer. She hated and feared him when he was mean. Girl kept trying to get away from him. It's again, disingenuous to say she fell in love with him. Both him and Gaston started out as dickbags, but the Beast was willing to work on himself and become a much better person. Gaston, even to his last moment was an aggressive person and refused to listen to Belle. Even with Maurice, while the Beast imprisoned him at first, he exchanged him for Belle, then also let even her go when Maurice was ill. To me one of the big themes of the movie is how you can change, better yourself and set things right if you try. (I think one song in the movie even has lyrics along those lines.) The feminists I talked about?

Sally Miller Gearhart > Sally Miller Gearhart (born April , ) is an American teacher, feminist, science-fiction writer, and political activist.[1] In , she became the first open lesbian to obtain a tenure-track faculty position when she was hired by San Francisco State University, where she helped establish one of the first women and gender study programs in the country.[2] She later became a nationally known gay rights activist. And Andrea Dworkin, whom I probably don't have to introduce at all. Conveniently, she is the only one who is considered a radical feminist, though not at all a little fringe no-name nobody. Please, do the typical thing and declare that the biggest of big name organisers or feminism are totally not actual feminists. Because YOU know what feminism REALLY is about, somehow Emmeline Pankhurt (suffragette and also white feather movement supporter), Germaine Greer (influential second-waver and also supporter of female-on-male pedophilia) or Marion Zimmer Bradley (celebrated feminist fantasy author and habitual incestuous child rapist) were not real.

I can still kind of see that goal post creeping back. >Kids are attracted to colors, not so much stories. Designing a story with pink colours but doesn't feature a relationship is absolutely doable and I don't think people take issue with it. It's the shows that are pink in colour and are pushing some tumultuous, romantic subplot that become a problem. Boy Meets World is about a kid, his brother and best friend screwing around. Season introduces a romantic subplot that's treated in a fairly healthy way throughout the rest of the series. Girl Meets World is about a girl and her best friend dealing with dramatic relationships right from day . Girl Meets World? You mean the show from ? >Shows advertised to girls(at least back in the s-90s) are generally about finding the right guy. There goes the goal post, out of sight forever.
