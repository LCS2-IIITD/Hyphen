"Always remember though that women saying men are all rapists and white men are ""the problem"" They are the fringe. The absolute dumbest of the dumb. They exist as a result of modern society making up for the fact that survival of the fittest has been co-opted. Never, ever let anyone tell you that this is normal person thinking because it is not. The media and academia have been infested with unbelievable non-thinkers that at the most generous are mentally deficient. We must call then out each and every time for the absolute nuts they are. We've let it be normalized where media and others think it's just fine to say this type of thing and we'll roll over.","# ::snt Always remember though that women saying men are all rapists and white men are ""the problem"" They are the fringe.
