"I love how the people on TwoX say the TheRedPill, MensRights, pussypassdenied, etc are echo chambers for apparent 'women-hating' but comments are very rarely deleted there and I've seen some of the crassest and most disgusting shit from brigaders on the larger threads. Yet TwoX is an actual echo chamber for self-delusional people who censor anyone with an other opinion. Have an opinion that seems to actually supported by many people? ""No you're disgusting stop being a women hater it's her body it's her life"" blah blah banned.","# ::snt I love how the people on TwoX say the TheRedPill, MensRights, pussypassdenied, etc are echo chambers for apparent 'women-hating' but comments are very rarely deleted there and I've seen some of the crassest and most disgusting shit from brigaders on the larger threads.
