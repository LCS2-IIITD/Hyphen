"Fuck soy milk. Fuck veggies. Fuck the left. ..... using your, and the rest of the GOPs Pinocchio noses. You complain of smelling shit, and yet you can't even pause for a breath because you're so dedicated to brown-nosing. I'm not ""triggered"". Its called being tired of little fuckers who think they can find their meaning in life just being associated with a group. Yeah, you're on the team Bud, just remember that they wanted the water bottles filled up before kickoff.","# ::snt Fuck soy milk. Fuck veggies.
