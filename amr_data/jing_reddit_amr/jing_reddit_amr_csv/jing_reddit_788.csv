"Uh... > In one instance, emergency caller Jim Moten told KTRK he called in after he spotted two vehicles speeding on a highway where people had been killed from speeding weeks earlier and thought his call had dropped after a few seconds. Not an emergency. You do not have calibrated eyes to test for speeds. You call the police directly and not the emergency line. Every highway has deaths on them from speeding it's not something special or new or important or even close to an emergency. Shouldn't hang up emergency calls but from the anecdotes given in the news post it seems like that entire region needs to be taught the difference between a emergency and a non-emergency is. That kind of call frequency of non-emergency on the emergency line is fucking stupid. days in jail though it's kinda not long at all but then again unless someone was actually harmed because of her shitty work ethic, i'm not sure a longer prison sentence would be worth it. Fired and banned from that line of work would be a far better idea if no one was harmed. Prison sentence for being a shitty employee is kinda stupid","# ::snt Uh... > In one instance, emergency caller Jim Moten told KTRK he called in after he spotted two vehicles speeding on a highway where people had been killed from speeding weeks earlier and thought his call had dropped after a few seconds.
