"This is a stupid article and proves nothing and shouldn't be on this sub. Williams didn't claim women got penalized more, she said women got penalized for doing less. The figures in this article have literally nothing to do with her claim. Show me stats showing the number of men and women who called a ref a thief and show how many were penalized. THAT is what you need. Sorry but can we not simply post women-hating stuff in here? This sub isn't about that. Let's be rational folk.","# ::snt This is a stupid article and proves nothing and shouldn't be on this sub.
