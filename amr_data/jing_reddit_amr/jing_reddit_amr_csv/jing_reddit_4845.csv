">Story of my life >Posts music video like a year old instead of something of actual value. Look, dude. Some friendly advice. If you want to be taken seriously, try typing and acting like a mature adult, ok? If you actually were trying to help me, it was lost in your edgy4u personality. Maybe, instead of being so awesome, you could come down off your perch and show some kindness to a fellow sufferer. It doesn't make you weak. In fact, helping other people can make you feel good. I know I get a burst of pride every time someone takes my advice and it works out well for them. Know I present my advice? Exactly the same way I present everything else, from the heart. Granted, we've got different hearts so you might have to kind of ""fake it til you make it"" but if you actually cared about helping people, you'd ditch the attitude. And you know what?

I was desperate, like I said. When someone is in a high-strung emotional situation like that, they need JUST the facts and/or some feels, not lip from an edgyboi. Just some food for thought.","# ::snt >Story of my life >Posts music video like a year old instead of something of actual value. Look, dude. Some friendly advice.
