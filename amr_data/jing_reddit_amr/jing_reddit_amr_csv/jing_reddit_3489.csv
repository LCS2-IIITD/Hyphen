"There's also the [Bleeding Cool article]() which, when combined with the posts, lays out a full confession by Mark Waid: he called the publisher, the publisher knows he is Marvel writer, he slandered Meyers, he encourages him not to publish Meyers, and he offered to give an interview in exchange. Rich Johnston getting dragged into this and accidentally being the cause of Mark's downfall would be fucking amazing.","# ::snt There's also the [Bleeding Cool article]() which, when combined with the posts, lays out a full confession by Mark Waid: he called the publisher, the publisher knows he is Marvel writer, he slandered Meyers, he encourages him not to publish Meyers, and he offered to give an interview in exchange.
