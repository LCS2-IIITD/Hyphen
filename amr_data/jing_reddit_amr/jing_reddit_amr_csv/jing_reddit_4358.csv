"My great grandma had her house broken into one night. Her husband had died and she lived alone She grabs the sawed-off. Finds two guys in her living room. Proceeds to go fucking full Rambo Grazes one of them. She gets shot in the ass with a . Burglars escape. Nothing stolen. Never found out who did it She had a couple potential suspects in mind, and shed fucking taunt them from her front lawn I can still picture her yelling profanities and pointing to her ass when certain cars drove by Shed always say *makes my ass wanna suck a lemon* and I still to this day have no fucking idea what that meant. After being shot in the ass, her references tended to be ass-related. I think she developed some kind of angry ass complex lol Point of the story: they dont make em like they used to","# ::snt My great grandma had her house broken into one night.
