"This seems to a bit of an idiotic topic but there is some merit it in perhaps... though I have seen anime that does the opposite. I'm not talking about like pointless abuse. Honestly in a lot of anime, they abuse the concept of smacking a guy around because he is a dense fucker and can't knock before entering a bathroom. This annoys me a bit too but it isn't a monolith. Take Maken-Ki ecchi as fuck anime. That happens to the main dude, he literally forgets because he rooms with a few chicks. Now it's possible to forget, but in a small defense of them. If you forget /7 that's being fucking inconsiderate. Secondly this guy does intentionally peep on chicks sometimes, so it's hard for him to claim innocence because sometimes he really *isn't* innocent. As much as I found inuyasha to be garbage for this, and other reasons, it made a lot more sense in Ranma /2. Ranma *went out of his way* to poke at his, somewhat betrothed's, insecurities. Sure people should get over their insecurities but when someone has insecurities about not being feminine enough maybe when you have to live with them you shouldn't tell them like times a day they suck at being a chick. Ranma was a dick to both Akane and other people at least half the time. Now, on the flip side you have recent shows like konosuba and Aho Girl. Kazuma right out states he's having none of this bullshit. he will also smack a bitch if he thinks she's being an idiot, not that ti works with darkness cause she's a kinky masochist and gets turned on by that, even when he acts disgusted at her behavior in public and means it. He will routinely tell aqua she is useless and a bitch in public- because she is. In Aho girl main dude is possibly a bit of a dick but he has lived around the main sex obsessed bitch for his entire life, her precocious ass would routinely do things to him in their childhood that he didn't want to do that might well border on sexual assault, he was too physically weak to stop her. This lead him into gaining more strength, probably mostly just happened because puberty. He now due to her current actions and past actions *knocks the fuck* out of this chick, who is in fact so fucking stupid she routinely gets zeros on all of her tests **all of them**. His aggressive, pretty much assault and battery, treatment of this chick scares everyone around him especially the other chicks, but he just has no more patience for this chick who is selfish, stupid as fuck,inconsiderate, and a **MEGA THOT** obsessed with his dick. So both extremes exist and largely played for comedy. The chicks doing it to dudes is more common but let's see western media even as a joke try to do some of the dudes not putting up with chicks bullshit. It wouldn't fly- Japan doesn't seem to give a fuck maybe because they don't seem to be as psychotic over there and realize that shit ain't real.","# ::snt This seems to a bit of an idiotic topic but there is some merit it in perhaps... though I have seen anime that does the opposite.
