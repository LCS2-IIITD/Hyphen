"> There is nothing in Islam that says men and women can't shake hands. Yeaaaaaaah....that's not correct. Islam is pretty clear on this: no shaking hands between men and women who are not ""mahram"" (a ""mahram"" includes the husband as well as all people that the woman cannot marry e.g. brother, father, son etc.). --- Exhibit A: It was narrated that Maqil ibn Yassaar said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: For one of you to be **stabbed in the head with an iron needle** is better for him than that he should touch a woman who is not permissible for him. (Reference: Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer, . Shaykh al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Jaami, , that this hadeeth is saheeh.) --- Exhibit B: Muhammad bin Munkadir said that he heard Umaimah bint Ruqaiqah say: I came to the Prophet () with some other women, to offer our pledge to him. He said to us: (I accept your pledge) with regard to what you are able to do. **But I do not shake hands with women.** (Reference: )","# ::snt > There is nothing in Islam that says men and women can't shake hands.

"> There are verses in the Quran that actually condemn Hadith by name. That's not correct either. Hadith is the collective word used for the sayings and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW).
