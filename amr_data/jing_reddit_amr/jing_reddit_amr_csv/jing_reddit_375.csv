Im sure you can agree that not all ideas are good things. They arent equal. If I had an idea that killing a bunch of people was OK (hopefully) you would say thats a bad idea. Its the same with ideologies. Someones blatantly racist views dont deserve to be heard and held up with other ideologies.,"# ::snt Im sure you can agree that not all ideas are good things.
