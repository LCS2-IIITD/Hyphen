"I think once you have had reassignment surgery you can call people total assholes for being prejudiced. Before that there is too much uncertainty. If you present as the gender you are transitioning to, and keep your equipment to yourself. It is likely nobody will know or say anything. There is no good answer besides having an all-inclusive bathroom/locker room alongside men/women.","# ::snt I think once you have had reassignment surgery you can call people total assholes for being prejudiced.
