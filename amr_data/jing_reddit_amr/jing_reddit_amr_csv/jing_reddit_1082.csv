"Riiight. Since it is pretty clear that Hadith is entirely fabricated nonsense there is still nothing in Islam that prohibits shaking hands. Lets imagine for a second if the Hadith you quoted was true, ) touching a woman in this context doesnt mean literally touch, it means in a sexual context ) those words sound very violent. I dont know why pretend Muslims who claim to love their prophet insist on portraying him as a violent nut job. There are verses in the Quran that actually condemn Hadith by name.","# ::snt Riiight.

"> There are verses in the Quran that actually condemn Hadith by name. That's not correct either. Hadith is the collective word used for the sayings and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW). And this is what the Quran says about the actions of the Prophet: **Indeed in the Messenger of Allh (Muhammad SAW) you have a good example to follow, for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allh and the Last Day and remembers Allh much. (33:21)** If the Prophet didn't shake hands with women, it makes sense for Muslims (who are told that he is a good example to follow) to do the same and refrain from shaking hands with people of the opposite gender. And if that seems extreme, consider this next verse: **""It may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allh knows but you do not know."" (2:216)** Since a Muslim believes in Allah, they also believe that His knowledge and wisdom are infinite. So if Allah has prohibited this action, as depicted by His Prophet, there's wisdom in that prohibition. The fact that we may or may not be able to grasp that doesn't change its value.","# ::snt > There are verses in the Quran that actually condemn Hadith by name. That's not correct either.

"> Additionally, the prophet wasnt allowed to preach anything outside of the Quran so if its not in the Quran then its fabricated. Relying only on Quran and rejecting Hadith would make a lot of things very difficult. For example, the Quran mentions many many times to offer prayer. How many rakaat? How to do ablution first? What time to pray? What to recite in prayer? What sequence of steps to follow in prayer? How many sujood in one rakat? None of these answers are available in the Quran. Only in the hadith. And that's just one issue, prayer. Similar problems crop up with zakat, hajj and many other facets of religion. Hadith is pretty much mandatory if you want to follow Islam properly.","# ::snt > Additionally, the prophet wasnt allowed to preach anything outside of the Quran so if its not in the Quran then its fabricated.
