">Hoard resources Considering the Batista's Cuba was a glorified whorehouse for Americans and mafia, the whole ""we just hoarded resources"" stuff smells like bullshit. Like when the former emigrant claims that he was driven out from the USSR because he just ""worked hard"" and then starts fapping off to an idea of having ""Russian bydlo working for him for food (food loan, to be more exact) and fucking peasant women"". No, mate, you didn't get kicked away because you were ""worked hard"", you spat on the community for years, and when time came, community spat back at you and you fucking drowned in the process. PS: Funny how it got positive at start, and then dindu nuffins sweeped with their downvotes.","# ::snt >Hoard resources Considering the Batista's Cuba was a glorified whorehouse for Americans and mafia, the whole ""we just hoarded resources"" stuff smells like bullshit.
