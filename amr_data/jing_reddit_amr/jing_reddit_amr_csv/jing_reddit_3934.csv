"I surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west. Take the wage gap for instance. First of all, the whole % of what a man makes is across jobs, not for the same jobs, so it doesnt necessarily prove that women are treated unfairly. But it does highlight some conservative values that still linger that that limits peoples choices through norms if not by rules. You could perhaps say that reducing the wage gap is a mens issue. Cause why do we have such a gap? We put a lot of expectations on women, but being able to earn a lot is not what we expect, so they might feel more free to pursue their passions even if it doesnt provide as much revenue, and take a workload that suits them better. Men on the other hand are considered more imporant, and are seen as more attractive, if they have money and power. So men put passions and personal well-being aside because we have to make money. Another thing that is important to remember is that we cant expect things to stay the way they are, even here in the west. Right wingers dont want women to have access to abortions or for kids to get sexual education(which makes the girls end up pregnant) and thinks marital rape is okay. And the alt right movement has been growing a lot the last few years and is still growing. Racists and bigots are always at work, and financial interests in politics will always need a social struggle that they can use to trojan in their own politics, so the extremists on both sides will always get funding. They're pitting them up against each other, trying to create polarized enemies, and in my oppinion you're falling for that tactic. This is a threath to the basic rights we take for granted, some of which we've had for decades already and are by no means considered progressive anymore.","# ::snt I surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west.

"> I surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west. Not in socialist Sweden.

It's frankly, not even real if you're doing a multi-varied analysis of the proposed issue.

That's the sort of anti-individualistic fascism and social constructive ideas I don't want in a free country. And ashamed of what feminism did to this country.

Yes, but to pretend conservative values only apply to gender differences is benign at best, idiotic at worst. The same conservative values is also why we respect religion despite it being a bunch of nonsense and why it's illegal to smoke weed, while nicotine cigarettes and a bottle of vodka a day is acceptable as long as you come sober to work. I'm not saying there aren't bad conservatives values, but I'm saying that there's a lot of complex issues we have to fight, and I believe fighting them as a libertarian for freedom, is way better, than fighting gender questions separately by using the governments to point sticks. > Cause why do we have such a gap? Why do people choose different jobs? I do know, that there's way bigger gaps between rich and poor people, than there are between poor women, and poor men, as well as rich women and rich men. (talking about earnings here, specifically). But overall, I think it's a complex issue, and I've never heard any feminist ever state they need to think about it and do a proper analysis and reach a conclusion, the Swedish feminist, left, environmental and socialdemocratic party is convinced that there exists a systematic problem, which they can solve if given enough power. That's not fighting for equality, that's pretending communism works and ignoring the dangers of trying to change the world. > We put a lot of expectations on women, but being able to earn a lot is not what we expect Since when is expectations bad? And who are we? I don't like being spoken for, and I'd say men in general need to be held under higher expectations, not that women should be feeling less expectations. But overall, I'd say, it's a liberal issue, everyone should be held at the expectations that they can reasonable be able to manage, as individuals. > Right wingers dont want women to have access to abortions or for kids to get sexual education(which makes the girls end up pregnant) Wrong, you're asserting American-centric politics here. Right-wings and left-wingers doesn't mean the same thing to us. Here in Sweden, even the Swedish Democratic Party (the nationalists) who want to ban all immigrants and throw them out, are pro-abortion. Literally % of Sweden is pro-abortion, it's **never** been a question here about yes or no. It's been ""how late?"" from the very start, we're a extremely non-religious country, even our ""Christian democratic party"" isn't anti-abortion. See how different cultures can be even in the west? I assume you didn't know that, which is fine, Sweden is a very small country, but I think it's dangerous to look at conservative views and assume they're dangerous or good, because they're different from where you're standing. We have conservative views in Sweden I question heavily which nobody can defend, simply because we don't even talk about conservative values, we just stay quiet about subjects that falls under that term. Drug use for example. It's just not discussed anywhere. And whenever it is discussed, it's whataboutism, in it's worst way. But you can't claim right-wingers want a certain thing because that's just not true in the west. The only ones who are fighting for things like anti-abortion laws are Islamists. And it's lefties politicians who let those into our political system. I'm not against immigration, but I am heavily against segregation that leads to poor integration into society. We have huge subgroups in Sweden who never learn Swedish, we have people following religious conservative values and practices which are illegal here, and our socialist government isn't doing anything because of how afraid everyone is to be branded as a bigot or racist for calling out shitty ideas and behavior. edit: I'd love to keep the discussion going, but I'm heading home for work now, have a great day!","# ::snt > I surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west.
