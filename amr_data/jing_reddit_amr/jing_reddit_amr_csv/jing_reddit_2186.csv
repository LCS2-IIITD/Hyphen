Ignorance would be bliss. Given the fact I have no real reason to care about the loop holes of some forsaken pig controversy that is just childish to begin within this context. This whole post is crap. ISIS and Terrorism is real. FUCK Iraq and the dumbasses that rule it. Perhaps the judges that judged the incels needs to hang as well?,"# ::snt Ignorance would be bliss.
