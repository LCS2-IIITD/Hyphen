"Because that would immediately make it so that you have to PROVE that they were lying which in itself is difficult to do unless they out themselves, which means in those cases where someone actually did do something horrible but got off because the investigation fucked things up, the person who did the accusing could stand to lose even more as a result because now it falls on them for 'lying' as that's the immediate out people who are accused will turn to. What needs to happen is that it needs to be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the crime happened in the first place before any kind of punishment is instated.","# ::snt Because that would immediately make it so that you have to PROVE that they were lying which in itself is difficult to do unless they out themselves, which means in those cases where someone actually did do something horrible but got off because the investigation fucked things up, the person who did the accusing could stand to lose even more as a result because now it falls on them for 'lying' as that's the immediate out people who are accused will turn to.
