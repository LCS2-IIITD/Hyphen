So you're not some woke dude or the first one who came here with the controversial idea of being against feminism. The majority of us here are. Everyone who disagrees with you, everyone who tries to shed some light on the issue of mysogynistic and sexist fuckers who come here to generalize and spout there bullshit (after being hypocrites and criticizing feminists of course) is either a ''feminazi'', ''feminist shill'' or a ''concern troll''. I'm seeing a lot of NPC memes describing feminists and the left but it seems being NPCs is not just limited to them. It's in the left, it's in the right, it's in feminism and apparently it's infecting the MRM too. Nobody is saying that women can't be pieces of shit, or evil or liars or whatever. Nobody is saying that we shouldn't criticize women or feminists. Nobody is saying that. Just don't generalize and say sexist or mysogynistic shit, that's it. God fucking dammit.
