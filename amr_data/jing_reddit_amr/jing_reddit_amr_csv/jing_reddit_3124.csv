"Yup, here's the gofundme and her B.S. excuse. She even asking for people to cosign or buy the car for her and she'll pay them back. On June th my wife Nikki was driving my vehicle and (at Not the fault of her own) was in an accident, totaling my car. She has sustained some injuries and is currently seeing a chiropractor/ pain management specialist. Unfortunately for me, my insurance only paid off my vehicle + $300 leaving me no cash for a down payment on a new car. Ordinarily, this wouldnt be an issue for me because I have excellent Auto credit. BUT I have terrible credit due to medical bills and credit cards from paying for my hospital stays while having severe epilepsy and lupus episodes. I am currently working with a debt consolidation company to get these bills paid off, but that doesnt reflect on my credit score.... I have attempted to apply for a loan solo, as well as with an amazing co-signer, and both have been declined. I live/ work in LA & can not rely on Uber alone. All donations are appreciated...","# ::snt Yup, here's the gofundme and her B.S. excuse. She even asking for people to cosign or buy the car for her and she'll pay them back.
