"I don't think the cop is innocent here... She pretty much had no control of her body, which is pretty small compared to any of those officers (and was therefore no threat to any of them), plus she barely grazed his head with an open palm (a slap), which wouldn't do much if any damage anyway. He straight up punched her in the head. HARD. Not saying she's innocent, just saying the cop overreacted and I don't trust that guy with a gun.","# ::snt I don't think the cop is innocent here...
