"Im wondering if anyone upvoting this will take a moment to read the article u/puffie300 posted in another comment here. Im not necessarily taking a side here, but its so common for people to jump on a bandwagon without the full story. It feels like Kony again. The father had a few criminal charges in just the last few years, and theres a good amount of evidence to at least bring up suspicion that this might be some bullshit from him. Again, not taking sides or saying hes a saint or the devil. But to blindly believe him is foolish and everyone doing so should be ashamed.","# ::snt Im wondering if anyone upvoting this will take a moment to read the article u/puffie300 posted in another comment here.
