Nazis were socialists as much as North Korea is a democratic republic. There's plenty of left-wing regimes gone wrong you could use as examples (like the aforementioned Maoist China). No need to go full Godwin's and try to claim the Nazis weren't social conservatives.,"# ::snt Nazis were socialists as much as North Korea is a democratic republic.

The point is lots of stupid people try to use the fact that they were socialists to say the nazis weren't right wing. As if it gives conservatives some kind of brownie points that a historical bad guy wasn't theirs.
