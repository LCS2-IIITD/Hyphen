"How the fuck is being in-between male and female supposed to work for NPCs addressing you? If we were being realistic about it, they would assume you male or female, or get confused and not be sure what to call you. They're not going to automatically call you special pronouns or anything. These are probably the same people who think cross dressing is automatically transgender or that a little boy or girl who doesn't act ""100%"" male or female might be transgender. Being transgender myself, I'll make my characters female if it has no major impact on gameplay, not this special in-between space. No doubt the non-SJW transgender people want to be seen as the sex they're transitioning too as well, not trying to pass off as someone intentionally trying to blur gender lines. Nevermind history, even today the whole in-between thing doesn't work because out in public, people are going to address you as what they think you are, not what you claim to be. If you look like a man, people are going to address you as such and vice versa. The whole preferred pronouns thing means jack shit to random strangers.","# ::snt How the fuck is being in-between male and female supposed to work for NPCs addressing you?

"I can explain very simply: You know how you desire to be perceived a certain way? So do other people By the same token that you wish to be perceived as female some people wish to be perceived as male. And by that exact same token some people wish to be perceived a way that is neither male nor female. It's not up to you or me to gatekeep which identities are legitimate. Let me repeat that because it is the core of my ""argument"" (I'm not arguing with anyone. No one has made any point on the topic that could be considered logical or countered by logical argument. I am shedding light on ignorance) >It's not up to you or me to gatekeep which identities are legitimate. Do I understand what a ""non-binary lesbian is?"" No. I consider that label paradoxical. **But** that doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense to the people who use that label. I would have to talk to one of them to find out what it means to them Using your ignorance as a stand-in for understanding is not the same as being informed; it is the opposite. People who do not understand an issue yet feel confident that they are correct are fools in the most classical sense of the word. I was not attempting to educate. I was attempting to shed light on ignorance. It is too fucking easy to educate yourself for you to put the ""burden of proof"" on anyone but yourself unless you're in a debate setting. If you are ignorant in with a smartphone in your pocket it's because you CHOOSE to be that way. ""Read a book"" is a phrase I use to let people know that it's obvious that they do not take the time to consider the perspectives of others (and to belittle them because I value being informed and belittle those who are uninformed). Because once you've read a book by a person who believes things that you don't believe you immediately realize that your viewpoint isn't worth shit compared to the reality that we collectively experience. I spent sec to google [""non-binary person interview""]() and here's just one of million results. If you want to sit through a poorly-edited highly-slanted view of events I'm sure Buzzfeed has made a dozen youtube videos about nonbinary people. Just like all other perspectives you expose yourself to you will have to be a critical thinker (which I think we can all agree on considering this is the GamerGate subreddit). There are no ""right books;"" there are only books. There are no ""right perspectives;"" there are only perspectives. Some people's perspectives are informed and compassionate. Some people's perspectives are uninformed and uncaring. Who's viewpoints do you value? Make choices. If you want respect then give it. If you want condemnation then spit it at others.

"This isn't about me gatekeeping identities. It's about how society at large will react. With transwomen, they are biologically male but they go through numerous processes to pass as female so that society will treat them as such. To try to pass as non-binary is going to get people to think you're either an effeminate guy or a tomboy. They're not going to see someone as being outside male or female. Do people make assumptions about gender? Sure, but they're right most of the time. You can't just go out in public, look like a man, then claim you're female and expect everyone around you to magically know you're supposed to be female. It may work among friends and in very specific spaces, but to the public at large, that doesn't work. I'm well aware of dealing with people acting like experts on things they don't understand. I deal with this a lot on numerous subject matters like my autism. It's even worse over the Internet. I don't claim to be informed on non-binary. I freely admit my ignorance when it comes to that. However it doesn't mean I won't question it just like how I question everything else. Hell people question me a lot over me saying I'm a transwoman. You're right. A lot of the stuff that can probably be found about non-binary are poorly done Buzzfeed study videos. Even if I did get informed, if I still choose to talk shit it doesn't mean I'm not informed. Perhaps if I heard what non-binary meant from a non-SJW viewpoint I would be a lot more understanding. I'm already in the same boat with being transgender and much of the transgender people mentioned in this sub are SJWs, making it look bad on us non-SJW transgenders. Blaire White is probably one of the only popular non-SJW transgender people and she gets a lot of shit from the far left because of that.","# ::snt This isn't about me gatekeeping identities.

"I agree completely, especially about how hard it is to be a non-leftist transperson and how many people don't understand autism (30%+ amiright?). But: you HAVE heard the definition of ""nonbinary"" from a non-SJW. It's just everything that isn't male or female (which means that it is INCREDIBLY broad. That's why it doesn't make sense to say there aren't nonbinary people). You're right that society is totally geared to label people into M and F. But that's changing because people are changing. Humans are naturally biased to reduce any topic down to a binary. But as we know that doesn't reflect reality; it is simply a shortcoming of the way we process information (and normally it isn't a shortcoming and it helps us solve a lot of our problems). IMO years ago a **huge** portion of society didn't *believe* in trans identities. They looked at a person and said: ""that's a dude in a dress"" or ""I bet that bulldyke is a carpet-muncher"" (or whatever they said. I wasn't old enough to notice so I'll just be as offensive and basic as I can imagine lol). But now trans identities are commonly recognized and generally understood (especially since the time when GG started). I foresee that a similar level of understanding will organically (aka slowly) spread over the next years about people who don't feel comfortable identifying as male or female. I might be completely off-base. Maybe society is only capable of being tolerant towards MtF and FtM and nothing else.
