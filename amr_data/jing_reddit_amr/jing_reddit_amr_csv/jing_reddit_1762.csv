"Somebody said something weird sometime, so now they cannot say something reasonable. I think their summary of the events and their analogy to the catholic church works very well. Yes, fandom has a religious element. I have seen a few zealots that will fight anybody opposing the true faith. And things will have to be seen if Disney adopts or if Fans will fork Star Wars with the old Canon and ignore Disney. The only problem is that Disney has the Trademark, which back in the holy wars there was no trademark laws concerning religion.","# ::snt Somebody said something weird sometime, so now they cannot say something reasonable.
