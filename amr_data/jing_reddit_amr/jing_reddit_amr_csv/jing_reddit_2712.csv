"Don't know. That lack of passion towards making your company more successful may be the totally rational reaction to the stagnating wages of the last decades. If they don't care about you, you certainly won't care about them. The young people of today grew up in that climate. They know it doesn't really matter how much harder they work, the wealth they create won't be shared with them, neither by wages, nor by taxes into society as a whole. It just will become then nth house or car or yacht or wife or mistress of the owners. They also know, no matter how much of their time an effort and health they sacrifice for the company, they are out the door, the moment they are not needed anymore. And they know all this by first hand experience. They know no other reality.","# ::snt Don't know.
