At days a week and factoring in mandatory overtime laws it would come in at per year on average. If this is a day work week then you'd be looking at annual If this is a day work week then you'd be looking at However these estimates are far from accurate. Cotton picking season in the best case is about months long and lasts from July to october. That time is crunch time though so it would be reasonable to work every day during this period. So that's days of the year. hour days with overtime factored in at the hr mark for each week. so (5x8x25 + x4x25x1.5 + x12x25x1.5) = on the best of terms. I would do this. It's a teacher's yearly salary at less working days than a teacher. It Doubles as a workout regime. And on top of it all it's tax free.,"# ::snt At days a week and factoring in mandatory overtime laws it would come in at per year on average.
