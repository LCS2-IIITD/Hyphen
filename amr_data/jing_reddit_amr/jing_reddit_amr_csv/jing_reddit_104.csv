I totally agree with you. I also very much understand the point why women usually do not prefer men roommates but what I don't understand is the very rude conversation she had and also the fact that maybe most of these female only ads are posted for places who actually have only men tenants or both men and women. If all these female only ads are posted for places which only have female tenants that means over half of places that have rooms for rent in Toronto are female only as well which cannot be correct.,"# ::snt I totally agree with you.
