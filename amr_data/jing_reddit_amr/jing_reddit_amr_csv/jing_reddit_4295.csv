"I understand that, yeah. But then we kinda run into this issue that the US as a country is super net-negative on funding since we run a deficit. Like how do we distribute the ""benefits"" that don't go to specific people like roads, law enforcement wages, etc? Basically only uber rich people with majority shares of corporations would be able to vote in that case I think. There's a lot of math to do haha","# ::snt I understand that, yeah.
