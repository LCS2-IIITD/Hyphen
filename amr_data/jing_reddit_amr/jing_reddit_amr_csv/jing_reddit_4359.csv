Men like you would swim through rivers of snot and vomit if you thought there was at least a chance of a sexual encounter on the other side, wouldn't you?","# ::snt nah that is just your sleazy slimy mind thinking you are superior to females and so think you have some right to look down on them on your imaginary pedestal you set your mind up on and it's the policy of the morally bankrupt overseeing the morals of women and men like you are so pious whilst you are doing it those girls have never even heard of you and don't even know you exist and still you insist they are dressing like that to tempt you, you the morally bankrupt?
