It's a bit more nuanced than that. You have to go into the authors views on public and private lives. Skin deep its a pro-military book. Under that is a commentary of Societal responsibility and how important it is. It's for that reason it's still recommended in west point /USMC reading lists. At the time it was criticized cause it featured an all-volunteer military with illegal conscription. It could just be a catchy tagline the publisher made. Me personally i See a functional system with badass power armor that lets you jump around like a flea equipped with a nuclear missile launcher.,"# ::snt It's a bit more nuanced than that.
