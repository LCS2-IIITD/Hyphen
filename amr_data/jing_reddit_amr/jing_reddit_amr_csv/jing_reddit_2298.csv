Please tell me what the point of your Imgur link is? What is the point of telling everyone that someone used T_D if not to try and discredit their opinion based on their post history? You're trying to use it to discredit what they think or say rather than refute what they've posted. It's pretty chickenshit but whatever.,"# ::snt Please tell me what the point of your Imgur link is?
