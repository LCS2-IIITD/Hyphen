"Torvalds has disgraced himself by allowing this shit into the Linux project. It's obvious what will inevitably happen when a project as complex, far reaching and critical as the Linux kernel is governed by any thing other than meritocracy first. However he had managed to maintain a culture of meritocracy for years, capably and without peer, before this happened. That should not be ignored when discussing him. Whatever happened to Torvalds that he shirked responsibility for this, at this point it's up to the community to fix. Whether or not they'll organise and fix this mess, who can say. What's certain is that as long as a method exists (and is inevitably used) to evict those who are meritocratically valuable, but politically unwanted, the submission quality will gradually decline until the kernel becomes unfit for purpose.","# ::snt Torvalds has disgraced himself by allowing this shit into the Linux project.
