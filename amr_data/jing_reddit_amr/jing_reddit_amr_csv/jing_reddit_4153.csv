If the first thing you are thinking when someone is acting like an idiot is that they are illegal then you should maybe go outside and find something else to care about. There is over million people in the country how are you going to assume that because she is being a retard that she belongs to a group of million. That is a .3 percent chance which is remarkably low. All I can see is that you wanted to start an argument about illegal immigrants because you are a butthurt armchair warrior with nothing better to do. Edit: just looked it up and she is a citizen that lives I. Los Angeles.
