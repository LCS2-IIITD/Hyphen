If she's not interesting no one would be watching her stream. Men find her body extremely interesting. Old guy should mind his business. She's not breaking the law or messing with him. It's not his bar and apparently she isn't breaking the rules of the establishment. If he doesn't like her behavior he's free to leave and take his business to an establishment that doesn't allow streaming.,"# ::snt If she's not interesting no one would be watching her stream.
