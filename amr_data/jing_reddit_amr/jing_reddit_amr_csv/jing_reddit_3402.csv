"So rolin, when he threw his coffee (which was maybe over the top) and she ran at him what were her intentions? A hug? Was she going to give him back his coffee?

He probably said.. hey fuvk off and in the video you can see she tries to ""get the last fat word in"" so he throws his coffee... then after realizing he ain't playing she rushes him. She's livingin a bizarro land where ""I'm a strong independent butter golem"" and also ""he can't hit me cuz I'm a girl"" You can't have both... What should he do about her running at him? Run away?
