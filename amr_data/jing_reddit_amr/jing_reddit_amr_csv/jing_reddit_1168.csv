"The way I see it, doing such a thing will only create more supporters of men's rights, so it'll be a loss/win. You and many like you will stop posting, but many others will simply risk getting banned/downvotes in more mainstream/neutral subreddits. In the best case scenario it could result in more supporters of men's right being more active in mainstream subreddits, but I'm probably being too optimistic. This is purely speculation, but typically when people are so passionate about an important subject like this its literally not possible to censor them all. Taking down the other subreddits will only bring more into subreddits like this. Once they are all gone? More subreddits will be created. ""But those subreddits will get banned too"" yes, and then the whole process repeats. Men's rights is more humanist, and more fact based than feminism is. It just holds more weight, and in my opinion is far less attractive to extremists looking for something to help push their toxic beliefs. I don't see how banning this sub would do anything but just create so many more MRAs.","# ::snt The way I see it, doing such a thing will only create more supporters of men's rights, so it'll be a loss/win.
