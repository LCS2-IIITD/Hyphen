"Everything Ive read including all the statistics on risk factors from pretty much any STI/STD resource website and Planned Parenthood information I come across says circumcision carries less risk of contracting HIV. The inner surface of the foreskin contains Langerhans' cells with HIV receptors; these cells are likely to be the primary point of viral entry into the penis of an uncircumcised man. Any time you want to look up the odds of contracting HIV during unprotected sex all odds are always higher for uncircumcised men, especially anal sex. There has been hundreds of studies apparently. So if everyone is conducting studies and clickbaiting us for attention and contradicting each other, than Im going to lean to the side that has a better reputation of reporting correct information. I guess we cant be % sure on the internet ever.
