"Guys this is the root of the problem: DEMOGRAPHICS. Canadians (really all westerners) are not having babies. Japan is what the future looks like with no immigration, strained gender relations, high male suicide rates and an aging population. Their stock market was flat for + years and the interest rate was zero (even negative), what that means is the people who retired and saved have nothing to show for it, no growth in stocks and bonds. Immigration is a way to keep growing, in our current system its the only way unless we magically start having babies. The problem with immigration is that some cultures dont mix and that leads to problems which could end up being worse than Japan. Europe doesnt seem keen on repatriating their lost children so they will follow on the same path as us.","# ::snt Guys this is the root of the problem: DEMOGRAPHICS.
