"I have a twin who plays Overwatch and uses Tumblr as their main social media. Ive heard many times about how, despite having the most colorful cast of characters Ive ever seen, the creators are racist, dont care about their POC fans, and how having characters like the gorilla and the hamster are racist because they chose those over a POC first. It all seems like a lot of bullshit to get worked up over, but to each their own I suppose.","# ::snt I have a twin who plays Overwatch and uses Tumblr as their main social media.
