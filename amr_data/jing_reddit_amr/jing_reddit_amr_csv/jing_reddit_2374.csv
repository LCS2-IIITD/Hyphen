"Because they sat on their throne for far too long, with no actual competition. Being the leader of the console sellers would inevitably make it the prime target for SJW bullshit and company infiltration, and given that the PS4 hasn't really sold all that well in Japan, it comes to reason their ""sensibilities"" would be more Western-oriented (i.e., the perfect victim of Bay Area Morality). It'd also stand to reason that the Switch's success out of fucking nowhere, and its perfect compatibility with PC gaming, has also somewhat spooked Sony, especially in regards to the Japanese market, so they're trying to one-up them now in the only way that ideologues know how to do business: shoot themselves in the kneecaps and claim victimhood.","# ::snt Because they sat on their throne for far too long, with no actual competition.
