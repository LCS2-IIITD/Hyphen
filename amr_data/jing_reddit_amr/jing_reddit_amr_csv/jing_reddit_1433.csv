"The most illuminating thing about this article isn't the article itself, but the comments where women defend the false accuser. One woman writes: > Ok she lied. She caused **some** harmreally to **peoples delicate feelings?** I think it opened a few very serious deep neighborhood discussions that needed to happen. I know it sparked more than one discussion in my circle of friends.. BUT THIRTY YEARS? She needs some psychiatric help (obviously because of the cutting,) but not years lets use some of that common sense and compassion and quit cow towing to the political pull. So apparently the pre-meditated tampering of evidence and fabricating a false story in an attempt to incarcerate innocent men is nothing more than ""hurt delicate feelings"" and this is a good thing because it's a ""discussion that needed to happen."" For some bizarre reason METOO will not denounce false accusers even when it harms their own movement and brings disrepute to real victims of assault.","# ::snt The most illuminating thing about this article isn't the article itself, but the comments where women defend the false accuser.
