"It does not say that in the article. And even so it does not make being charged for ""antisocial"" behavior any less *ridiculous*. The charges for assault would be one thing, but we both know damn well there are legitimate abuses of power going on in the U.K. The very notion that being offensive/disagreeable should be criminal is fucking retarded.

"As I stated, you're reading with an american perspective on the phrase, ""antisocial behavior"" isn't a charge for just people the government doesn't like. Its not like if you're just a shitty person they're going to charge you or if you just don't like people. It has a legally defined limitation. Its just that rather than having separate charges for noise ordinance, harassment, disturbing the peace, etc. They just have a single charge and that way the judge can levy the punishment accordingly. That way the cops aren't in a position to choose your sentence, the judge is. as for abuses of power, if you live in the US, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. the UK isn't anywhere near the silly oligarchy that the US has become.","# ::snt As I stated, you're reading with an american perspective on the phrase, ""antisocial behavior"" isn't a charge for just people the government doesn't like.
