"Ya she is, but this is more important: There is actually a lot of Tao wrapped up in Hank Hill. Hank Hill is very much an ancient Eastern figure. He is the essence of calm and serenity when all is within balance in his world. The first time I saw the episode where he teaches Luann pool chemistry, I could just feel the serenity radiating from the screen as he surveyed his harmony. Or when he uses the smaller WD-40 can to open the larger WD-40 can. He found his center, and through that was able to foresee all possibilities within his universe. His adventures always come from trying to restore balance and explore his comfort zone outside of balance. Seriously, Hank hill is the motherfucking Tao. Seriously. Everyone go get high as shit with a vaporizer and watch King of the Hill right now. It will help you on your journey to your Satori.","# ::snt Ya she is, but this is more important: There is actually a lot of Tao wrapped up in Hank Hill.
