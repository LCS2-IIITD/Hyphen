"Hilarious as that is, those anti speech laws are still there after we've all had a good laugh at a moron being kicked in the arse with them. They're a tool to control discourse and ideas with the full force of the criminal justice system; it was wrong when they were used on Dankula and it's wrong now, no matter whether we hate the guy or not. Have a moment of schadefreude, sure, but remember what this represents.","# ::snt Hilarious as that is, those anti speech laws are still there after we've all had a good laugh at a moron being kicked in the arse with them.
