"Not sure about the UK, but permanent alimony is still done in states like Florida. There are men in Florida that cannot voluntarily lower their income - they can't retire, they can't cut back their hours, they can't take a leave of absence and bum around and ""find themselves"" if they want to. They are essentially chained to their jobs. I consider it slavery. I didn't know it at the time, but my grandmother did this to my grandfather for about years, till the day he dropped dead.","# ::snt Not sure about the UK, but permanent alimony is still done in states like Florida.

That's why the US get's worse ratings on slavery than European countries.,"# ::snt Indentured servitude is considered a form of slavery by most anti\-slavery orgs.
