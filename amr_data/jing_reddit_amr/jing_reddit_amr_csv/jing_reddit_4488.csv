"People need to eat a big slice of humble pie these days. Our society is spiraling out of control, and everyone things they're a special snowflake and better than everyone else. I've seen that shit, too. The wives love to throw out, ""Do you know who I am?"" and demand the same respect their husbands receive, without doing anything to earn it. I don't give a shit what your rank or title is. I don't care what your profession is. I don't care how high or low on the corporate, military, or government ladder you are. You wake up in the morning and get out of bed just like everyone else. I've always struggled with being subordinate to people. It makes zero sense to me, especially in today's world. People who get promoted into a higher position, more often than not, are less competent and deserving of respect than the people they are over. You see it in government a lot, from the military to government agencies. They encourage mediocrity my promoting it -especially when it's in the form of PC appeasements.","# ::snt People need to eat a big slice of humble pie these days.
