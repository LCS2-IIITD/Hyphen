"Same happened to a buddy who was about to be my new roommate. We had a female roommate who had gone through a bad breakup before she moved in with us so she came home hammered drunk every night, stripped her clothes off and tried to fuck all of us. Then one night we have a house party to welcome new guy a week before he moves in and she's all over him (apparently they had hooked up in the past) begging for him to fuck her. She saunters upstairs to her room, screaming his name, no clothes on. She didn't seem very drunk, she must have been doing shots in her room or something, but she's dead set on my buddy's dick. Obviously he can't resist and they spend the night in her room. Party ends and I lock all the doors and clean up a bit before bed. I hear nothing, no screaming for help, nothing. Next morning she comes in my room saying he raped her.... Turns out she does this quite often....gets drunk and regrets it and then cries wolf. This was according to her mother, who came a week after this happened and was apologizing profusely.","# ::snt Same happened to a buddy who was about to be my new roommate.
