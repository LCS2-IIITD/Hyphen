"don't trip dude. Women are so screwed up in terms of what they deem attractive that only % of men overall are considered attractive by women's standards. This was concluded from research studies where they polled women, with images of different guys to see how many they would see as ""above average"" and ""attractive"". Keep doing you bro, keep it pushin, keep making your life better. You'll start to notice women wanting to date you as time goes on. And let's keep it real, they do that because they will see that you have a nice job, house, etc. So treat them the same way in return, use them for what they bring to the table (looks) and dump. Wear a fucking condom. Don't be that guy that gets trapped in an unwanted pregnancy for child support, because they WILL try to do that to you.","# ::snt don't trip dude.
