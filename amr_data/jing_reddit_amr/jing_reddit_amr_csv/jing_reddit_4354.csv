"I am a bit puzzled by the article, I must say. >Weinman complied with a breathalyzer test... The article does not say if the test was positive, but the charges listed in the article do not mention anything about drinking. So it seems the test was negative? [This article]() says she passed **two** tests and that both were negative. >but the situation escalated when she refused to give the officers her name. Isn't she perfectly in her right refusing to give her name if the test was negative? >One officer could be heard saying saying he's ""done with"" her and works with another cop to try to arrest the woman Why? For refusing to give her name? For having an attitude? >Weinman resisted arrest Wasn't that arrest illegal to start with? Honestly, this looks more like a case of police brutality than a ppd.","# ::snt I am a bit puzzled by the article, I must say. >Weinman complied with a breathalyzer test...
