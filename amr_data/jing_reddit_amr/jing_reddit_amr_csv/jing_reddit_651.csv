"There wasn't anything proper about the execution bud, she could barely get her forearms around the dudes neck, let alone her elbow under his chin which is the proper execution of a rear naked choke. The bouncer was more than capable of shaking her off, but instead he just stood there and let her hang off of his neck from behind....essentially choking himself out. Dunno if he was too drunk, or was showing a level of IDGAF due to whatever history they may share, or just a complete idiot. In either case, the attacker's movements make it clear shes not trained to choke people out and caught a lucky move on a dopey bouncer.","# ::snt There wasn't anything proper about the execution bud, she could barely get her forearms around the dudes neck, let alone her elbow under his chin which is the proper execution of a rear naked choke.
