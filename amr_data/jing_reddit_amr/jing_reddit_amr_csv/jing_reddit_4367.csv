"> Cheong himself refuses to identify as alt-right, a decentralized far-right movement littered with white supremacists, but the language and political beliefs in his videos largely reflect alt-right beliefs. > For one, Hype Breaks video implies that GOGs critics are all NPCs, an alt-right meme dehumanizing the far-rights opponents as if they are lifeless and mindless AIs. There are several other dog whistles the video relies on too. Wrongthink is commonly thrown around to portray queer and feminist spaces as cults where people who think the wrong way are punished. And then theres no bad tactics, only bad targets, which is a catch-all phrase used by Gamergate supporters to portray online activists as deranged harassers mobbing targets with no concern for collateral damage.
