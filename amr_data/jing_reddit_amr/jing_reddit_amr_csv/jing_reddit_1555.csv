Summary: Rekieta Law goes through Lawyer Mark Zaid's extremely long motion to dismiss Richard Meyer's lawsuit against Mark Waid for tortious interference and defamation. Zaid claims Waid is not subject to Texas jurisdiction and does some extreme twisting of logic and words to reach that conclusion. The major hilarious points are . Waid/Zaid claiming he has no business in Texas but he regularly attends conventions there and even offered to do business with the owner of Antarctic Press in exchange for them not publishing Meyer's comic book. . Waid/Zaid claim that defamation was never done in Texas yet there is video/articles of Waid repeating his defaming points against Meyer at a convention in Texas. . Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not initiate contact with Antractic Press. Waid's own Tweets and previous statement contradict this. . Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not know Antarctic Press was located in Texas. Waid stated he knew the owners when he Tweeted he was calling them and called a Texas phone number. The lengthy livestream where Rekieta Law tears apart the motion and is in full rant mode can be found here: [](),"# ::snt Summary: Rekieta Law goes through Lawyer Mark Zaid's extremely long motion to dismiss Richard Meyer's lawsuit against Mark Waid for tortious interference and defamation.
