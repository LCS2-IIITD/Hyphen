"They have the right to that relationship, but not to have that relationship be free of influence from their other actions. He isn't denying her custody, she still has that as she is legally entitled to. She simply isn't legally entitled to have her kids love her or be protected from their opinions of her highly unethical behaviour. He hasn't denied her that relationship, but the nature of that relationship has been altered by her own actions. He has no responsibility, legally or morally, to lie to his children to protect his cheating ex-wifes feelings. Its not surprising that the kids hate her. When you cheat you violate a trust. You turn your back on a promise you made to a person you said you loved in front of your entire family and God. You violated the trust of the person you claimed to love with all your heart. Obviously the kids are mad and don't trust her. How do they know her relationship with them is real? She already betrayed one person she loved. You are simply no longer entitled to respect or unconditional love in return from any of your family once you do that.","# ::snt They have the right to that relationship, but not to have that relationship be free of influence from their other actions.
