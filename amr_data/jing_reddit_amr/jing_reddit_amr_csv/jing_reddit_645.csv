"Im pretty sane. Slamming a weak girl weighing kilos head first into the ground to detain her, when you could just as easily have squeezed her wrist hard, and shed folded just as easily, isnt proportional, because the officer had the possibility to use less excessive force. That is what is meant, when I say, that it isnt proportional. If hed head butted her then it would have been equally bad.","# ::snt Im pretty sane.
