"She's a teacher she can't be dumb! Only a smart person could make such a perfect analogy like ""Ben and Jerry's, or Cold Stone Pizza"" when talking about those darned fascists! I also thought the her calling Milo a Homophobe was pretty ironic. Seeing as he's pretty openly gay. I hope she gets the book. Unless you actually witness one of these ""Nazi Rapists"" actually doing something to harm someone physically, you really have no right to attack them with violence.
