Chill. 'incels' is just the moronic catch cry of the week the same way as 'dog whistle' was the week before and 'snowflake' and 'toxic masculinity' was the month before. In another weeks' time some other trendy catchphrase will pop up on the John Oliver show and buzz feed before making the rounds on social media and everyone will start using it to shut down everyone else until it loses all meaning as well. My money's on it being something to do with Jordan Peterson or th of July. When someone instantly yells 'incel' you just know that they're an ignorant twat who absorbs their opinion through Facebook memes and Twitter posts.,"# ::snt Chill.
