"Yeah I'm kind of surprised. Ubisoft seem to pander more in PR then they do in their actual games. That said, there are definitely undertones if you look for them. Rainbow Six Siege for instance, most of the operators were male in season , by season they're about /50. And you pointed out several more. I guess what I'm saying is, Ubisoft panders in a somewhat superficial way that I've seen so far, unlike say Wolfenstein where they put a woke black women right in your face telling off the protagonist for being a white man.","# ::snt Yeah I'm kind of surprised.
