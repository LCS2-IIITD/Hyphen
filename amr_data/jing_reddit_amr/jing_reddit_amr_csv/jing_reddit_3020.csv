"Trophy hunters pay top dollar to hunt specific animals in a specific reserve, it is regulated heavily and lots of the money goes to promote activities that improve the reserve itself and nearby community. Poaching has no regulations, and is illegal. Im sure people fly to Africa and poach, but thats a different thing than trophy hunting. Hunting can actually be good for an ecosystem in many cases. Then theres the massive cash influx that trophy hunting brings to poor communities.","# ::snt Trophy hunters pay top dollar to hunt specific animals in a specific reserve, it is regulated heavily and lots of the money goes to promote activities that improve the reserve itself and nearby community.
