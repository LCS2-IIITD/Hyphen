"""Free market"" is a libertarian idea. And, I [got flak](/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9ne5th/censorship_antiwar_critics_of_establishment/e7lpd28/) for saying this last time round, libertarianism doesn't work in the wild. Some societies tolerate a version of it. Others will eliminate all signs of it with extreme prejudice. A ""government"" is an entity that has a (de facto) monopoly on force within a geographical area. Once corporations grow beyond a certain size and gain the ability to influence the politics of not just villages and towns, but states and nation states, **they need to be regulated, broken up, or, if nothing else works, nationalized.** When you think of free markets and libertarianism, don't think of some heavenly utopia. Instead, think of Negan and his club.","# ::snt ""Free market"" is a libertarian idea.
