"I considered not posting it, but I thought about it and realized that if this was a man, it likely would have gone down differently. Like you said, a man would be more discrete...why? Because if he had gotten in the cops face like that and pushed for minutes and not taken no for an answer, he likely would have been in cuffs. So my position is, she tried to use a pussy pass, the fact that she's not perceived as a threat as a woman, as a vehicle to get enough credentials and connections out of her mouth, hoping one would trigger the officer to say 'oh, shit, ok, this is going to end badly for me' and let her go. I just don't see it getting this far with a man.","# ::snt I considered not posting it, but I thought about it and realized that if this was a man, it likely would have gone down differently.
