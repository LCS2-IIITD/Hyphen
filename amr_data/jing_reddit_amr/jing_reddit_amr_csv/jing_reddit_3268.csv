"The reason I work is because Im ambitious and want to keep living my upper middle class lifestyle. I also have too much pride to be a useless leech and mooch off of my parents not doing shit with my life. Nothing wrong with living with your parents as long as its until you finish getting your degree, establishing a career, and saving up for your own house instead of settling for renting a shitty apartment. If you have no shame, by all means stay home with your parents and play video games till they die of old age then what are you gonna do live off of welfare ? Thats some beta ass shit to me, a true man will work hard and reap all the benefits by not allowing a bitch into their life to take it away.","# ::snt The reason I work is because Im ambitious and want to keep living my upper middle class lifestyle.
