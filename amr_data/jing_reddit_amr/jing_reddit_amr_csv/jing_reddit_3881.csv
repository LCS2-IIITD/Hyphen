"This is why I don't want any male children. I'm afraid a woman will try to ruin his life with false accusations out of spite. If I do have any sons, I will tell them to focus on academics before considering dating a girl. I will fully explain the consequences of dating, marrying, and having children with women of poor moral character. It's scary the amount of women I'm friends with on Facebook that are into the Me Too and Believe All Women movements.","# ::snt This is why I don't want any male children.
