"Ok, serious question here. I'm im my late s. Back when I was in highschool, the school I went to probably had about seniors on a given year. I knew a good chunk of the people who were in my grade, and only of them were openly gay. I'm sure there were a lot more gay people who just didn't want to come out or were just still figuring things out, but I guess my point is that nobody went around pretending they were a celestial being, or a dog, or had a gender that was neither male or female. Reading some of these stories, it's as if all that bullshit is basically the new fad now and in any given class of , you have nonbinary kids, gay kids, and transgenders. Is this just made up bullshit, or are kids really falling for that crap? I'm not saying that all of them are phonies, but in the OP, it seems there are at least queer people and one asexual person... That seems like a bit too much and I'd guess that if these stories are true, a lot of it is just rebelious teenager type thing... Edit: Typo... Late s, not s. I'm not a dinosaur.","# ::snt Ok, serious question here. I'm im my late s. Back when I was in highschool, the school I went to probably had about seniors on a given year.
