"Is it really though? Evolution is what made organisms that reproduce by fission and budding. There is a species of lizard that is entirely female and reproduces via parthenogenesis. Snails and worms are hermaphrodites and some plants can self pollinate. Male clownfish will change sex if the dominant female in the school dies. There are also gay animals of nearly every type. All of that came about through evolution, and it isn't remotely heteronormative. There's just about every viable reproductive strategy imaginable.","# ::snt Is it really though?

"If we limit it to animals, maybe. Plants have multiple ways to reproduce asexually. There is a forest of over genetically identical trees with a root system that is years old. Dandelions manage to spread pretty efficiently with asexual reproduction as well. Once we start looking at fungi, things get more complicated. They can spread if their mycelium, similar to a plants roots, are broken into pieces. Each piece just grows into a separate organism. But that's just asexual reproduction of fungi. They can also reproduce sexually, but I wouldn't call it ""normal sexual reproduction."" At least not in a heteronormative way. Instead of sexes, they have mating types. Instead of anything that can be called sperm or an egg, both mating types create the same type of gamete. Some species can sexually reproduce with themselves, while switching between mating types as they do. Then you get to bacteria, and everything just breaks down entirely. They reproduce asexually, but they also engage in horizontal gene transfer, easily exchanging DNA with entirely different species. Asexual reproduction can be incredibly efficient and diverse.
