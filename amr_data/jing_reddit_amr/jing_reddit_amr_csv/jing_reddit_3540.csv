"If you are a manager, especially a male manager, you project a relaxed and quiet toughness and awareness of your surroundings. If you're in a meeting with only three chairs and people come in and one of them is an old lady you don't even wait you just stand up and offer her the seat or offer to look for more seats. Management is leadership and you can't be a leader if you are afraid of women or if you are afraid that being humble makes you look weak.","# ::snt If you are a manager, especially a male manager, you project a relaxed and quiet toughness and awareness of your surroundings.

You have to be blind not to see all of the mgtow types in here salivating every time a video comes out of a woman being brutalized for a relatively minor offense like pushing somebody.
