"All Ill say is that Ive enjoyed this sub for a couple of years now. Over the course of the last ~3 months or so, it has just become a forum for hate speech rather that the subs intended purpose. As a non-nod I cant do anything other than un-sub and hope for the best. Also, Im not going to defend a pre-op man for being in there if it presents direct danger to anybody, but making others uncomfortable is something that people will have to get over. That is no different from calling someone who considers themselves liberalistic a snowflake, which Im happy to now see has had its proverbial tables turned and is now applied to hose of far- or alt-right views. Its quite ironic and I, personally, find myself quite jovial about it.","# ::snt All Ill say is that Ive enjoyed this sub for a couple of years now.
