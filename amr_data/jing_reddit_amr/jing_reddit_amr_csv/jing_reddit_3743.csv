"There's also very distinct groups of Elves. The Aen Seidhe are the ones in the world the books and game are set in, they're very much downtrodden because comparatively they live longer but breed slower, so humans came along and just outbred them with numbers replenishing their losses faster. Then you have the Aen Elle, the Elves from the other world. The ones that make up the Wild Hunt. They're superior to the Aen Seidhe in almost every way. They're fucking huge standing at feet tall or more whereas the other elves are often the same size or smaller than humans. They still have their war machine running and mages that can and will fuck things up. The Aen Seidhe take part in guerrilla warfare because they don't really have the numbers for anything else anymore. The Aen Elle show up on a magic flying boat, freeze everything solid, and then stab anything still moving. Then stab anything that isn't moving. Then set fire to everything just to make sure. If you're lucky enough to avoid all that, they might just take you as a slave to live out the rest of a very short life which will also wipe your memory even if you do somehow get away. They don't fuck around, and they're not to be fucked with. It takes the combined might of the most powerful spellcasters in the world to even stand a chance against them in the games, and the only reason they lose is because you cut off their political support in the forms of reinforcements. If Ge'els was still working with Eredin at the end of W3 it would have been a very different outcome. The Wild Hunt would have killed everyone, taken Ciri, probably then burned down all of Skellige, killed all the Nilfgaardians present which included the Emperor at the time, and then later would have invaded the rest of the world and wiped out everything standing in their way, human or otherwise. There is no good and evil race in the Witcher, that's part of the point. You have individuals or groups that stand out for those points but they don't represent the entire species. Even vampires have morally grey characters such as Regis and Detlaff, which is an unfair enough thing to say since they're not human and have very different ways of living, being very much more creatures of instinct than what humans are. Of the monsters in game most of them are more like animals than anything, killing for food rather than out of terror, and the exceptions to that are often being controlled by something else. Geralt specifically mentions he doesn't kill sentient monsters just because, trying to find a way to solve the problem involving them rather than just stabbing them until they stop moving. There are numerous examples of monster contracts where said monster did what it did because a group of humans decided to start shit in the first place. See the male troll in W2 that's mourning his wife the local humans killed for being a troll, or the succubus in W3 who killed some guards because they attacked her first, or many of the ghosts that are only ghosts because someone fucked them over in life. The single most evil creature in the entire game is probably something so powerful that you quite literally can't kill it. You can trick it and defeat it through a technicality, but that's it. You never in any standing hope have a chance at actually fighting and killing it since it's near enough the actual embodiment of evil in the universe rather than an actual living creature, and what does it spend most of it's time doing? Tricking people into making deals and selling their souls. Yes it can kill, yes it does kill, generally out of annoyance at someone wasting it's time, but despite being actual evil and the most powerful being you will ever meet in the game it doesn't just go around killing everything in sight just because it can. Even the Unseen Elder you can meet in W3, which is probably the second most powerful being in the game, doesn't randomly murder just because it can. You make it a point that unwanted attention on the vampires in general from what is happening would be a problem, despite vampires being so much more powerful than humans and yet it's a point the Elder accepts that point. This is a creature that can literally move faster than even witchers can react to yet it agrees to helping because it doesn't want things to cause trouble, and this comes after you do a quest where you see what just ""normal"" Higher Vampires do against regular humans and you're lucky if you fight and kill % of the soldiers there because the vamps just mow down everything without pause. The Elder is above even those in power and it still decides that not fighting is the better option. This is all of course stuff I don't expect the show to deal with. Race doesn't equal species for these people making the show, so the actual racism in the witcher world between humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc will be probably ignored in favour of intra-species racism despite the outright stupidity that suggests when you have both actual different races in the world and monsters which are far more important threats.","# ::snt There's also very distinct groups of Elves.
