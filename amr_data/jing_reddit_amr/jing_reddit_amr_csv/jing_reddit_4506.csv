"What the fuck do married guys talk about with their wives? A woman's whole life and purpose is to land an attractive, high net worth man and trap him with children and marriage. The woman has nothing other than fashion, beauty products, and dating drama to talk about because that's their entire lives revolve around. There would be nothing to talk about other than house chores, and what to put on TV. I'd blow my fucking brains out.","# ::snt What the fuck do married guys talk about with their wives?
