The cop did have a short fuse but she was incredibly disrespectful. She put her hands on an officer which is a big no-no. I tell my kids to respect and cooperate with police. They have a stressful job. If that was my daughter I would be more appalled by her disrespect for the police officer than the cops reaction to her disrespect. Im siding with the cop. What pisses me off even more is her going on the news to accuse the cop of excessive force. She definitely needs to check her entitlement. If I acted like her and I got slammed by a cop I'd be blaming myself. She gave him reason to react and he did. Suck it up.,"# ::snt The cop did have a short fuse but she was incredibly disrespectful.

The problem I have is that she was standing still and the cop walked up to her then pushed her. I'm sure anyone here would have gotten pissed off too if you were standing on a public sidewalk and a cop walked up then pushed you when you haven't done anything wrong. I don't see this as a PPD so much as a cop with a Napoleon complex.,"# ::snt The problem I have is that she was standing still and the cop walked up to her then pushed her.
