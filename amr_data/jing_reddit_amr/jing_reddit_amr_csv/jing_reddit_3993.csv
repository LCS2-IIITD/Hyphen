context: Shared an article about the single bachelor life. Trigger a feminist (sleeper cell didn't even know she was on my list.) She brings in her friends and a white knight mangina. Got to love how they think shaming someone as single is a well thought out insult lmao. I see this all the time mostly white knights and simps who gloat about their relationships as if they have won the lottery and you're a loser for not taking part in it. But this just amused me greatly so I had to share.,"# ::snt context: Shared an article about the single bachelor life. Trigger a feminist (sleeper cell didn't even know she was on my list.)
