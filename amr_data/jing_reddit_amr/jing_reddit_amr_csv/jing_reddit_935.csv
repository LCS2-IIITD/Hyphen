"Yongyea probably has the most plausible theory. Schrier updated the article to say that it might not have been intended for Blizzcon. However, he is adamant that the video exists with someone on the original Diablo team, as if he had actually seen the video himself. Perhaps early on, the video was intended for Blizzcon, but changed relatively early. Or never intended for Blizzcon in the first place. I think we should wait and see what Blizzards first bit of promotional material might be.","# ::snt Yongyea probably has the most plausible theory.
