"So equality for you would be breaking from the principle of proportional justice, one of the most fundamental ones in virtually JUST EVERY FUCKING LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE WORLD that's worth half a shit, so that someone (in this case, let's just be honest, you just care that it's women) for lying under oath would get punished the same as a typically very violent, and very physical act, for lying to fuel your hate boner? Cool Also , you fucking illiterate dumbasses, the felony is called ""perjury"" and it's the same if a man lies about another man or woman or any other configuration you want. It has nothing to do with rape or about ""women having an advantage"" in the legal system (imagine being so big of an unashamed illiterate, that you actually believe shit like this unironically). It also varies from state to state , and yes the minimum is typically year, but under a federal case you get up to , depending on the intent you had when you committed said perjury,etc. And even worse, you can also get away with fucking rape with a year sentence. Even if you actually did it. HUH, see i made a scary statement there. It's almost like we have this principle that guides how the justice system punishes people.... HUH Of course this all depends on what actually happens, and WHERE, and turns out judges actually consider all of this crap when making ruling since they actually more about their field than any of you fucking morons will clearly ever know about literally anything. And finally, of course, you have the fact that false rape allegations resulting in convictions aren't a widespread issue in the slightest according to just, well, virtually every credible authority on the subject. You drooling morons really should, at all times, refrain from talking about big boy topics. Stick to fueling your hate boners with random videos of women getting hurt or whatever, it somehow makes you look less retarded than this.","# ::snt So equality for you would be breaking from the principle of proportional justice, one of the most fundamental ones in virtually JUST EVERY FUCKING LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE WORLD that's worth half a shit, so that someone (in this case, let's just be honest, you just care that it's women) for lying under oath would get punished the same as a typically very violent, and very physical act, for lying to fuel your hate boner?

Response is pretty much as expected. Lots of name calling and no substance. People like you come in here day in and day out all butt hurt crying mysogyny and flinging around statements you have a pseudo understanding of. You are the hate filled one not us. By all means do stay. Toying with you will amuse me. And the longer you stay the more you will learn. We are about equality here between the two genders. You may not like how we do things but things are the way they are. If you are going to stick about may I suggest you dispense with the repetitive name calling. Its boring and will only serve to get yourself trolled into oblivion. Good luck have fun and see you around.,"# ::snt Response is pretty much as expected. Lots of name calling and no substance.
