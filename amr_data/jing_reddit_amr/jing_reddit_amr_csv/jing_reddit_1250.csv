"Married woman tried to branch swing to me. I told her she needs to divorce first, then maybe we could see what happens. She demanded I commit before she gave up her husband (current branch). I shut her down. Then she started sending me messages about me dating a woman years younger than me. I don't know where she got this idea, but I had no reason to argue with her so I just let her keep believing it. I didn't feel a need to ""prove my innocense."" I think she was doing it to make me look like a creep, so she could feel better about emotionally cheating on her husband.
