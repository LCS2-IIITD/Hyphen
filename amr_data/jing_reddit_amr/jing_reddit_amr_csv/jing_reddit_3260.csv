"I can understand a hardship payment if she stayed at home to take care of their daughter, thus preventing her from reentering the workforce. But I have a strong feeling that this is not that case. Based on what the article listed as her former position, she had been working. And the nature of their financial situation, I would guarantee that they probably had a nanny. This is just a situation of a bitter ex wife. For all we know, she may not have wanted to put out for him any more and that lead him to stray. Ladies have to understand that unless there are legitimate health concerns, men want sex. It's a healthy part of a relationship. And if a woman denies them that without legitimate cause, then it could be reasonable justification for divorce or having an affair. Tell a woman that and they will go insane, but it's a simple truth. The same applies to woman as well. I have know girls who cheated on their boyfriends because they would not put out for them. But in these situations, the girls wanted to get pregnant. In any case, I would guess she was bitter before the affair. It is a part of 'empty nest syndrome'. When you discover that you no longer have anything in common with your spouse, you can become bitter. He probably wrapped himself up in work, and I imagine she did as well. But that does not discount the fact that he is a man, not an ATM.","# ::snt I can understand a hardship payment if she stayed at home to take care of their daughter, thus preventing her from reentering the workforce.
