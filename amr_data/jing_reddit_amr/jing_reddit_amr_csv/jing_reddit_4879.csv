"I wasn't drugged, but I have almost no memories of my life, so I empathize with your memory gaps. It's hard not being able to remember things like other people, but I am luckily going into a career that lets me look things up. I hope you find a way to succeed or completely recover. Good luck.","# ::snt I wasn't drugged, but I have almost no memories of my life, so I empathize with your memory gaps.
