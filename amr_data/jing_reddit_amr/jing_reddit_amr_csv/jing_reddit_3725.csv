"This is something that echoes a bit with me as you see the same thing between tech industry and science. Employers love to write off long work days to be something proud about but to me it's really exploitable and just a deep flaw of various cultures (it's a global phenomenon, really). On reddit, far too often when I warn peope to not simply accept working + hours on a h a week contract, they get very defensive and claim everyone else is lazy. The h/week standard is that way for a good reason. You need a healthy work-life balance. You will likely be busy enough just having a household and aside from that your brain and body need to rest. To deliberately push your body beyond without receiving extra payment and the choice to refuse is exploitation. But it not this way, especially not for startups in science and tech both and also academic positions, already starting at the PhD level. Hell, I too am expecting to graduate with my doctorate in a little over a month, but I for sure had -60h on average for a h a week contract. It is the norm despite seemingly scamtastic. Two things need to happen: we need to stop glorifying destroying yourself physically and mentally for the pockets of your employer and people need to unionize more or start getting more with programs which protect worker's rights. Germany has good unions, but the same cannot be said of france, NL and the US. And especially for you americans out there: I as a european cannot believe that you can find work without having a legal contract! Making it mandatory to have a contract should be the first step in making things better. A contract is not there to limit you. It is a way to protect your rights and prevent your employer from exploiting you. You have a legal document you can at all times refer back to and nobody can debate it. In france (and I think NL too) at the very least for overtime you are obliged to be paid extra. People I know let me know that sometimes they are send home after their h shift is over purely due to the fact that the employer does not want to pay them more. Edit: Due to some comments on this: Of couse it's very reasonable to have a crunch busy period and expect to work a lot, then have periods where you are not busy at all. I am not saying we shouldn't ever have crunch periods. However, we should avoid them when we can and not encourage employers to chronically understaff because they know they can get away with long term giving people h work weeks on h contracts.","# ::snt This is something that echoes a bit with me as you see the same thing between tech industry and science.
