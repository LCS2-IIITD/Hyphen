"I watched up to season of Supergirl and called it quits. I can tolerate a bad tv show quite a lot, but Supergirl I quit on season . I watched episode of season and said fuck it. Star Trek Herpes I went up to episode and a half or and a half, it was a forgettable crappy mess. Legends of Tomorrow, cant even stomach it anymore. The worst part was the nazi cross over episodes on Arrow and Flash. Wow, that was uber cringe!","# ::snt I watched up to season of Supergirl and called it quits.
