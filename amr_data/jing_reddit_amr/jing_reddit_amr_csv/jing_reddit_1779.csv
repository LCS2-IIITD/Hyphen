">For the th time I got served cold grilled chicken breast, it was warm at best (I don't pay for cold/warm-at-best chicken plus I'm a hypochondriac and don't want to spend the next days shitting my guts out due to food poisoning) >I got annoyed as fuck at the fact they don't understand they're to serve it steaming hot ffs, fucking cook that shit throroughly smfh When you are served food that is not a minimum of degrees F the restaurant is in violation of health codes. Ask to speak to the manager immediately and calmly explain that you know what the health code is for your city. If they do not fix the problem then ask for a refund then leave. Call the local health department and file a complaint. Surprise health inspections are not fun for any company. > I got mad and yelled at the cashier (female) (yes I shouldn't have done it, that was inappropriate but it was the th time ffs, and yes, I do feel sorry, not because she was female, but because I could've articulated it in a civilized manner) >A whiteknight simp told me I do this one more time and he's gonna jump me I would have told you to apologize to the cashier because you were acting like a barbarian. Hell I would have even called the police to have **you** arrested for disturbing the peace. >I told him to stfu, keep his distance or else he'll go to jail >Motherfucker attacked me, I grabbed my pepper spray and sprayed all over his puffy face >He brought his homie, he attacked me too, he got sprayed too There is more to the story that you aren't telling. I can easily see that you antagonized them with your words which lead to them attacking you. Nope, I don't feel sorry for you. They should have called the police and had you arrested for disturbing the peace and making violent threats then following through with assault on two people. > I exited the restaurant and went on my way back home. I'm not going to go there at least for the next months, but anyway, I think I de-escalated the situation appropriately by applying legal self-defense. Sure, like I said, I shouldn't have yelled in the first place, but he only attacked me because the cashier was a female (made clear through his sentence: ""Apologize to the lady"") Umm you didn't apply legal self-defense as you were the aggressor and violating the law. I pointed out which laws you broke, so any actions you did aren't legal. My advice is for you to not be a dick and to stop breaking the law. Also don't lose your temper because it shows you have no control over your actions.","# ::snt >For the th time I got served cold grilled chicken breast, it was warm at best (I don't pay for cold/warm-at-best chicken plus I'm a hypochondriac and don't want to spend the next days shitting my guts out due to food poisoning) >I got annoyed as fuck at the fact they don't understand they're to serve it steaming hot ffs, fucking cook that shit throroughly smfh When you are served food that is not a minimum of degrees F the restaurant is in violation of health codes.
