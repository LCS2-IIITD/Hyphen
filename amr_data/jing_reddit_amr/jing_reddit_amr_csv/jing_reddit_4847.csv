"""The consent decree stems from a lawsuit the DNC filed in after the RNC sent mailings to predominantly African-American and Latino households, dispatched armed off-duty law enforcement officers to the polls in minority neighborhoods and hung posters warning about penalties for violating election laws. The consent decree was issued to halt repeated misconduct, intimidation and discrimination, said Wendy Weiser of the liberal Brennan Center at New York University. Now the really toxic political atmosphere raises the risk of misconduct of having private partisans try to police the polling place. Its an intrinsically risky and problematic thing.""","# ::snt ""The consent decree stems from a lawsuit the DNC filed in after the RNC sent mailings to predominantly African-American and Latino households, dispatched armed off-duty law enforcement officers to the polls in minority neighborhoods and hung posters warning about penalties for violating election laws.
