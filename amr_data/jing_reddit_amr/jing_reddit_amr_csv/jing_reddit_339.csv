"I kindof liked the catcalling scene. First, they were going well beyond a simple catcall. They blocked her path, threatened her, and were actively harassing. And, she pulled a gun on them. Flipping the tables and even gave a speech, ending with, ""why are you still here?"" It was a correct flipping of intimidation. ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"" As far as Im concerned if women responded like that, to getting cornered in the street, there would be less catcalling. They even had the audacity to have a white women, pulling a gun on some POC. That scene was not exactly as Woke as some of you think. Turning Bullseye into Dexter was a bit odd, and even calling him Dex.. (poindexter as his last name is canon. lthough also subject to unreliable narrative, Bulleye is a notorious liar and sociopath.)","# ::snt I kindof liked the catcalling scene.
