"I would have thought that him showing himself to be a lying disingenuous cowardly hypocrite would be sufficient. Lets run down the examples: Starts his YouTube career as an Anti-SJW atheistic MRA who strongly identified with the MGOTW movement. Then he gets a girlfriend. So he ditches the MGTOW bit. Girlfriend is s a feminist, so he drops the MRA too. But wait...shes also a Muslim so that atheist bit has to go and he becomes a Muslim apologist (he did an interview on beauty and the beat if you are interested). Shes also a SJW so all his anti ways of thinking go too. So hes now a progressive Muslim apologist who strongly supports feminism. Bit of a change eh? But people change so maybe its not all bad. Except he secretly sets up a Sargon parody twitter while publicly saying he supports Sargon and that the parody account is silly. But thats just a minor thing. Because of his new beliefs though he starts reaching out and befriending and supporting people he previously strongly criticised, namely, Steve shives, Christi winters and Kevin Logan. Finally (recently) audio leeks have shown him involved with the whole kraut doxing server and lets not mention the fundraiser he did to get his GF out of Saudi Arabia. After all that I cant take anything he says seriously","# ::snt I would have thought that him showing himself to be a lying disingenuous cowardly hypocrite would be sufficient.
