"I was disappointed that GTA V didn't have a female protagonist, tbh. You've got three characters. Make one of them female. God, could you imagine a strong female character in Franklin's place, constantly having to prove herself and beating the shit out of Trevor when he tries to molest her? Think blonde chick from the latest Riddick movie. That would have been dope af. But nah, just a black guy from the burbs with no money, coming up through theft and general dickery to get riches and getting involved in government plots and shit. But enough about the protagonist of San Andreas let's talk about Franklin too. Then again, I saw their attempt at a 'strong female character'. That stupid cunt that's with Lester, who just EXUDES cunt. Holy fucking shit I wanted to actually strangle her. The worst part of grinding the Fleeca job was listening to her shitty 'tough girl' monologue where she's trying to be SO STRONK but just comes off incredibly cunty. I'm kinda glad they didn't make any of them female after that.","# ::snt I was disappointed that GTA V didn't have a female protagonist, tbh. You've got three characters. Make one of them female.
