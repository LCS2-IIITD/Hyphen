"Can I just say, as someone from Belfast who has been following the case, I don't believe this is an example of PPD. The different stories told during the trial, of which there were many, would suggest that the rugby players don't believe they were raping the girl, but that the girl fully believes she was raped. The sexual acts tread the line of consent and everyone seems to have been very drunk at the time, but I don't really believe this was a case of the girl trying to falsely accuse these men. It's just a horrible situation for all parties. The girl probably feels like justice hasn't been done, whilst the boys feel they don't deserve any of this nonsense.","# ::snt Can I just say, as someone from Belfast who has been following the case, I don't believe this is an example of PPD.
