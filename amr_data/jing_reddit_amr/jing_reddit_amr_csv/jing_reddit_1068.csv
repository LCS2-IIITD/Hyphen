"**USA** has us by the balls. I wont even bother describing the stranglehold US has over us. **China** pretty much owns B.C. at this point, the Liberal party, and big chunk of premium real estate. And is in the process of buying farm land in Canada and many other countries. Not to mention Huawei hardware runs our cellular network. **Saudi Arabia** has so much money and dick up our asses to the point govn't refuses to cancel arms contracts. Oh and it controls the Canadian Wheat Board among other things... But muh Rushah! /rolleyes.jpg","# ::snt **USA** has us by the balls.
