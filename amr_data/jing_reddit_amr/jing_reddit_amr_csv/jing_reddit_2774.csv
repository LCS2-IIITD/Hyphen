"From my experiences, this is how a lot of sjw type lgbt people are, and it's bloody annoying. All they seem to talk about is how they're soooooo gay and how they have soooooo many mental health issues and so on. They can do what they want, of course, but it's just irritating when it's the tenth time they've discussed how gay they are that day. The lgbt people I know who are less involved with extreme social justice are fine, though. They bring it up sometimes, sure, but not every single conversation.","# ::snt From my experiences, this is how a lot of sjw type lgbt people are, and it's bloody annoying.
