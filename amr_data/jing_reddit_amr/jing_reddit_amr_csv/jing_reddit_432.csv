"So lets try this, in elementary school when there was a student that couldn't understand a conjunctive sentence they were taught to break it down and say it in individual sentences. This is the original sentence: >the statements made by the alleged victim and her friends when interviewed by police simply werent adding up. Then when we break it up into two sentences: >the statements made by the alleged victim when interviewed by police simply werent adding up. and >the statements made by her friends when interviewed by police simply werent adding up. However, your argument is that it MUST be interpreted this way. That is not how grammar works. In middle school we were taught that in order to simplify a sentence, you removed the prepositional phrases and treat the sentence as a simple verb/noun/direct object. The sentence then reads as: >the statements made werent adding up. with the prepositional phrase: >by the alleged victim and her friends This is then diagrammed to show two objects of the preposition: VICTIM and FRIENDS This means that if you read at an elementary school level, then the ghostofB interpretation can be the only one.
