While watching my character grumbled about how he was going to ""kill everyone of you hooded rats"" before I even pulled a weapon. I mean yeah the KKK is bad, I just find it funny that a clearly very simple and ignorant white man in knew how woke it was to avoid bigotry and supremacy.","# ::snt You're not wrong.
