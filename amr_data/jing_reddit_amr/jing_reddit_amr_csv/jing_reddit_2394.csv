"Guns need to be banned because people don't know how to use these tools of defence in a responsible manner. Therefore we need to let the law enforcement groups provide protection to the people of this nation. But wait.... Leftists have told me that we cannot trust the government because the gobernment is gorrupted. And these law enforcement groups work for the government. What are we to do? Oh shit a guy is pulling out a firearm at us. He still needs seconds to maul us all down... I'm sure the police are going fling in like supermen and save us all. In all seriousness, don't go for gun control. Your neighbouring country Mexico have gun control laws. The population got disarmed and yet in the end the cartel disarmed their government. Now they run things in the country the way they want more efficiently than the Italian mafia and making the local people's lives miserable.","# ::snt Guns need to be banned because people don't know how to use these tools of defence in a responsible manner.
