"Is Sargon wrong here though? Jim constantly gets involved in political things, and then whenever he's challenged he immediately retreats to ""I'm just a troll""/""I'm just shitposting""/etc. He's a total coward, he time and time again tries to get in on these issues but doesn't have the balls to follow through or actually make anything because that means for once he might actually have to defend something, and that's not a position he's willing to put himself in. If he wants to stick to making fun of spergs on the internet, he can do that, and I'm sure everyone will have a laugh with him, but don't talk about political issues if you're too afraid to actually defend a stance.
