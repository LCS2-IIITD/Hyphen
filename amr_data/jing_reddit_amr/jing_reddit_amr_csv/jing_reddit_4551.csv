"Is this about black Heimdall and black Domino and the lack of outrage about them being race bent while people start forging flaming pitchforks over a black Ciri or Superman? Well, I'd argue that as supporting characters they are given more freedom to be fluid in their race and possibly even sex. They don't have the same identity with the public like a main character like Superman does. And if their written well then they race bending is excused as open casting rather than a forced diversity hire.","# ::snt Is this about black Heimdall and black Domino and the lack of outrage about them being race bent while people start forging flaming pitchforks over a black Ciri or Superman?
