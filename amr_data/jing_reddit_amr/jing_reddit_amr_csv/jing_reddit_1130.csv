I don't think the yennifer one is that bad. I think you could make them look similar with the right makeup. Her big hurdle will be acting more mature than her age without overdoing it. I don't remember Fringilla at all so I'll not weigh in on that one.,"# ::snt I don't think the yennifer one is that bad. I think you could make them look similar with the right makeup.

"on this - I have to say people disappointed are being silly, Fringilla being black is a non issue, we ALL know according to the lore, sorcerreses use glamours, they can look however the fuck they want - it is believable, lore friendly, and does not break the narrative, Yennefer is a fucking hunchback, Triss was badly burned - if they can change themselves to look hot, why is changing skin color so hard to accept. As for Yennefer, The actress is half Indian/half Caucasian, and according to her other Photo's looks damn good. Stop making a mountain out of a molehill. &; Look, bottom line up front, we ALL KNEW some changes were going to occur, just like the Games giving Triss red hair, there is going to be some creative license. Would I have preferred they created new characters to include diversity, sure, as there is no reason to not have sorceresses and witchers from Zerrakania (sic), but, as long as they stay true to the Plot characters descriptions and appearances (Yennefer does), it's no skin off my back.","# ::snt on this - I have to say people disappointed are being silly, Fringilla being black is a non issue, we ALL know according to the lore, sorcerreses use glamours, they can look however the fuck they want - it is believable, lore friendly, and does not break the narrative, Yennefer is a fucking hunchback, Triss was badly burned - if they can change themselves to look hot, why is changing skin color so hard to accept.

"Trying to pull the high road card is classic NPC behaviour. And of course I'm not going to watch the show! But the point of this sub, GG and similar movements is to voice protest while our stuff is being taken away from us. Our cultures, our memes, even our lands and our history, and we not only have to take it like cucks, we have to pretend that this is a good thing, They already destroyed Star Wars ( which, granted, had the multiculti rot in it from day one) by making it expressly political and SJW stupid. Witcher, too, is part of our cultural heritage and it was a rather interesting take on fantasy back when american books were still not tired ripping off Tolkien.
