"I just want the option to play big scary guys with rough voices, especially in rpgs. The closest I got is Doomguy I guess, and surprisingly showing how much personality you can do with gestures and without showing the face of the character. Voice acted protagonist was one of the big mistakes of Fallout . Basically ruins the one core thing about older Bethesda format and why people keep playing them with different characters. Now the character always sounds and replies like he's from Joss Whedon film. I want Frank Castle, Gray Fox, Kratos and non-cucked B.J Blazkowicz do the return as male voices.","# ::snt I just want the option to play big scary guys with rough voices, especially in rpgs.

I literally restarted Mass Effect about hours into the game because male shep's voice was so lifeless. I'm sure there are people that prefer male shep but acting like anyone who says his voice acting was poor is doing so for ideological reasons is retarded. &; Still got to romance Liara either way.,"# ::snt I literally restarted Mass Effect about hours into the game because male shep's voice was so lifeless.
