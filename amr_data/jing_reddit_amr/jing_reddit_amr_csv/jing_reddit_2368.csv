Compared with the rest of the (nationally representative) polling sample, progressive activists are much more likely to be rich, highly educatedand white. They are nearly twice as likely as the average to make more than $100,000 a year. They are nearly three times as likely to have a postgraduate degree. And while percent of the overall sample in the study is African American, only percent of progressive activists are. **With the exception of the small tribe of devoted conservatives, progressive activists are the most racially homogeneous group in the country.** [AHAHAHAHAHA!]()","# ::snt >Progressive activists are the only group that strongly backs political correctness: Only percent see it as a problem. > >So what does this group look like?
