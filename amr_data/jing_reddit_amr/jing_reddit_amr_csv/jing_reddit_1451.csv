"It would be really difficult to argue that Lovecraft wasn't racist and xenophobic, those are both quite obvious. But homophobia and misogyny? I'm not *that* familiar with his works but in the dozen or so that I've read I cannot recall a single instance of either of those. In fact, I don't think I've ever heard someone call Lovecraft misogynistic before this article. Can any experts chime in here? Did his writing have signs of hatred for women that I glossed over?","# ::snt It would be really difficult to argue that Lovecraft wasn't racist and xenophobic, those are both quite obvious.
