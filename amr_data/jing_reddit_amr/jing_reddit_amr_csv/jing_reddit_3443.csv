"I always thought it was retarded to align all of one persons beliefs with all the beliefs of a group. Are there SJW on the right? Certainly. Are there neo-nazis who lean more left? Without a doubt. To group ourselves in to these rigidly defined groups only further divides us and makes us at odds with each other. Divided we fall. And thats what those in power want. Disorganization and infighting. There is no other person I know on this planet that I would say I agree with % on everything and yet we call ourselves right, left, Democrat, Republican, etc.","# ::snt I always thought it was retarded to align all of one persons beliefs with all the beliefs of a group.
