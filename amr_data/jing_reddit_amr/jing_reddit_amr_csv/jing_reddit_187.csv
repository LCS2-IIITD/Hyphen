"Lol. This sub is slowly turning into r/incels/, jesus some of these comments. It's a fair question to ask. My partner asked it of me, but I didn't really like the idea of it, so I said no. That's it. Human beings are by nature, attracted to MANY different people, not just one. Being in a relationship doesn't change that. The boyfriend in this post reacted completely irrationally and I can't help but think he was looking for an excuse to break up with her if he left her that easily.","# ::snt Lol.
