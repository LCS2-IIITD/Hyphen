"Very well said. When I was reading your post, it sparked a thought. You discussed the incels looking for female validation. Why would a normal person seek validation from a weaker being? I'm sure this has been discussed in depth on this sub but I'm relatively new, so I'm sure I missed it. As I think about it, I felt reassured and comfortable when my ex and others would express agreement or encouragement for my successes. Looking at it from where I am now, I was far beyond any of them in everything I did. I had more $, more degrees, a better career, and better everything else that I had EARNED. It's funny looking back at how I thought I needed their assurance. I don't need anyone's assurance anymore. I hope everyone else on this sub gets to where I'm going. GYOW!","# ::snt Very well said.

">Why would a normal person seek validation from a weaker being? Incels believe they are weak. Well they are weak actually. But they could become strong. They swallowed the feminized culture and pursue a standard that was imposed on them. They grew up on feminist schools with girls who rejected them and mistreated them. Because of all the media most boys feel like incels until they lose their virginity. A lot of Chads dont realize initially they are Chads, and when they are young like before they go through similar shit. So this all comes down to male disposability and a degenerate simpish society. This is what makes men believe they are weak and that is a lost battle, they struggle against themselves and other men for a trophy that is their own slavery, its all a big lie. >Looking at it from where I am now, I was far beyond any of them in everything I did. I had more $, more degrees, a better career, and better everything else that I had EARNED. It's funny looking back at how I thought I needed their assurance. Its not hard for men to beat women at their own game in dating. In life. In work. In sports. Everything. They just need to focus on that. But incels have a point, because society being gynocentric and now giving them jobs and positions, its making the life of incels hard because meritocracy is being forgotten in place of gynocracy. Meaning it matters less to be productive and hardworking but if you are the one who knows more people and you are more feminine and submissive, and at the same time you have no honor, you have some looks, thats what will get you the job. You see? So incels are indeed fucked, but its not in dating that they are fucked, they are fucked in life, in society itself. They would be once great fathers and great providers, even great soldiers. >my ex and others would express agreement or encouragement for my successes. Looking at it from where I am now, I was far beyond any of them in everything I did. I had more $, more degrees, a better career, and better everything else that I had EARNED. Me too i experienced the same with my girlfriends. But i also noticed one thing, they barely needed to put any effort in their lives to get ahead, be that socially, professionally or at the university. They were mostly retarded, but they were priveledged for having a vagina and they dont realize that. Hopefully with the recent scenario and all the redpills in the west that might change, or else it wont be only the incels getting affected because past a certain point it becomes complete scorched earth and its all chaos, like the mouse utopia experiment.","# ::snt >Why would a normal person seek validation from a weaker being?

I forget that most people dont get off their ass to fix themselves. I do it almost every day! You do have to take a break sometimes! I guess I've never understood the incel game. Find your pond and fish in it. If you're + lbs, fish at Walmart. I guess it's a brain game at some point. Oh, you're dead right about them making no effort to get ahead. My ex could but rarely did. She always just said I was smarter or more educated. All it took was me reading the book! Lol! Well, I've fought to get ahead. I've made more $ than my bosses in my last few jobs. It's degrees and experience. I've changed careers and gone from engineering into data. I lost experience in the field but now I bring a terminal degree. We'll see how it plays out. I figure if anyone (women) are too much of a pain, I'll enforce that they call me by my now legally valid prename of Dr.
