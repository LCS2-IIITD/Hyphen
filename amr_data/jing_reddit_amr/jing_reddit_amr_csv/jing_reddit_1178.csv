"You should either explain why you think were both idiots, or you should hit the downvote button and move on. If you came in just to throw an insult out, look at your post history buddy. My opinion of you from a second glance is that youre a complete fucking nerd, have no real social life, fat as fuck, but still think youre superior to everyone. Now that stuffs probably not true (I hope), but thats how I view you. You thinking we are both dumb is fair, but its laughable that a fat virgin nerd with no friends is calling people dumb as if your opinion matters or is warranted. Either add something, or lets start an insult war and see where it lands us.","# ::snt You should either explain why you think were both idiots, or you should hit the downvote button and move on.
