"Just call them Incel. It is the new N word for white men, and it's so offensive it's like the N word and the C word had a baby. And just like the N word or the C word, you can attribute any and all of your sexist, racist ideologies to this derogatory term. Only with zero repercussions, since white males are not considered humans anymore.","# ::snt Just call them Incel.
