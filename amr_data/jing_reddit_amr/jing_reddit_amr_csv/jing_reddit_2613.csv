"Frankly, this footage has nothing to do with PPD i think. Policeman was right to take an action against her, ""yes"". But you have to react with the same or slightly more strength to immobilize or eliminate her to take another action. It is just ""Brutality"", they could've easily handcuff her. Otherwise it will be like ""Wow you hit me with a balloon so i have now right to beat you to dead"".
