"I guess gaming plus SocJus (due to how Dice conducted themselves and how their game is marketed) pushes this over the threshold? Anyway while the whole world is discussing about some throwaway comment by a Rockstar bigwig no one seems to have picked up on the real story this week: Dice keeps losing developers. The article mentions other studios poaching then as well as people quitting due to the stress caused by the Battlefront lootbox fiasco. Nevertheless I would not be surprised at all if Battlefield V played a good part, too.","# ::snt I guess gaming plus SocJus (due to how Dice conducted themselves and how their game is marketed) pushes this over the threshold?
