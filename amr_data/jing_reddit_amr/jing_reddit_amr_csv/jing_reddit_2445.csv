"Well said. Not at all crowdsourced. Not at all organic. SocJus is a specific, intentional, contrived post-religious faith. It was formed to create the base rank and file of useful idiots in a grand Alinsky strategy. They only thing crowdsourced about SJWs are how their norming dynamic works. They appear to be ""crowdsourcing"" recruitment or blue-pilling, or whatever. But, in fact, they don't convince anyone that way. SJWs are indoctrinated into the faith almost exclusively in college...a few in primary schools. (It is the academics who are the top of this whole insurgency). I suspect the confusion about crowdsourcing is simply a confusion with how this vulnerable group of mostly Millennial-aged young adults seek to enforce and maintain community norms upon one another. Thus, the twatter dogpile. Pretty much all other age-cohorts lack this dynamic by a large degree, including the generation following the Millennials...so it's not just a function of age/tech. Something very specific happened to Millennials, mostly in college, which radicalized them philosophically -- and which conditioned them to a permanent state of cyber-witch-hunts. Gen X missed out on this, so mostly ignore or evade it (from without). Boomers, well, .... meh. Gen Z have come up under the boot of it, so have figured out how to evade it from within...and how to meme it for extra salt.","# ::snt Well said. Not at all crowdsourced. Not at all organic.
