Probably gonna a let dragon lady out on bail with her hot ass coat hangers and they'll set up shop by Ferndale. Prostitot might be safer out there than in the school with all the lead in the water...but Detroit kids get a belly full of lead one way or another eventually so maybe they'll build a tolerance..","# ::snt Yeah tone ""ghost"" from the victory inn is still around here (you can.
