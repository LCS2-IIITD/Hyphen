"During a League of Legend match or Starcraft game, nobody cares that I find hot dudes attractive. Nobody can know your sexual orientation, race or sex unless you go out of your way to advertize that to other players. YOU injected this into a place it dosen't belong. YOU are being disruptive in the most welcoming place ever, where none of this matters. So quit being a faggot and play the game. Not everything is about your shallow obsession with advertising you sexual orientation /7.","# ::snt During a League of Legend match or Starcraft game, nobody cares that I find hot dudes attractive.
