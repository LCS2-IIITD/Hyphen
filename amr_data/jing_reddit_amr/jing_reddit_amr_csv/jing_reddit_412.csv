"That really shouldn't surprise anyone. If a man were to try to live as a woman and integrate into common, traditional women's groups and keep up that facade about who they were for that length of time, he would need therapy too. It takes an entire childhood to learn how to be an adult man or woman. I think sex and gender are biologically linked and absolutely fundamental to who we are as people, and attempting to circumvent something that fundamental for that extended of a period of time is likely to cause distress that needs to be rectified. What she did is essentially begin the same type of transition that a MtoF transgendered person faces, without the therapist to help. Part of that transition involves getting LOTS of therapy and ensuring at every step that this is the way the patient really wants to live, and teaching them how to live as their desired sex.","# ::snt That really shouldn't surprise anyone.
