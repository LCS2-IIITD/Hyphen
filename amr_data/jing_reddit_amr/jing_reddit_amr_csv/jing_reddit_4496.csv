"Nah Craigslist cheaper than people who never look think. For example I have a maid who cleans my house I pay $100 a month. My last couple moves I paid $150 total and they provided the labor, truck, supplies. A lot of people doing the are illegals, felon, homeless, and starving college kids; it pays, especially given cash, WELL above minimum wage like /15 times as much. I know a couple people who do this as supplement income and to your point, don't even own a truck. They get a day rental from Home Depot or Uhaul and just use it all day moving other people.","# ::snt Nah Craigslist cheaper than people who never look think.
