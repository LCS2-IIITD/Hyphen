"Sure. So for years, games ""journalism"" was basically shit, and nothing but paid advertisement for the games they ""reviewed"". Everyone knew it. Then one day, this girl who made a choose-your-own-adventure game started fucking games journalists for good reviews. Her boyfriend got pissed off and told the community at large about it, and this got gamers very angry with games ""journalists"". Gamers got upset at this new evidence of a long-standing problem, and it kind of became ""the straw that broke the camel's back"". Rather than admit that it's wrong to take sex from game developers in exchange for good reviews, the games ""journalists"" decided to deflect from the issue by pretending that what the gamers were angry about was that a girl made a video game and that it got a good review. Games ""journalists"" all talked together privately and a couple of days later they all released articles that pretended that this whole debacle was about gamers hating women, and not about games ""journalists"" dicking female developers in exchange for good reviews. No matter how the subject was brought up, they would plug their ears about the actual issues and try to shift the focus to ""gamers hate women"". Then the gamers started really going for the throat, doing things like reporting them for not disclosing sponsorships and affiliate links, doing all kinds of work to essentially expose all of their bullshit. Meanwhile the games ""journalists"" kept doubling down, people started faking death threats to make this seem like a credible issue, and the opportunist women and ""journalists"" set up patreons and kickstarters to suck dry any chump who thought they were serious. Nowadays, Trump is Making America Great Again, all of these games ""journalists"" and white knights are being found out to be accused (and thus by their own standards, guilty) of sexually assaulting women, everyone's well aware that games ""journalism"" is just paid advertisements and fake news, and we're over here laughing and having fun playing the same kinds of video games we used to, for the most part.","# ::snt Sure.
