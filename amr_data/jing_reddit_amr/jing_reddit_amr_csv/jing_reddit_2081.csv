"Interesting. So the post was only up for minutes, dont know how you expected a huge discussion to have already taken place. But if youre actually interested in an answer I can give that to you. I am the breadwinner in my relationship, and Im a woman. I do feel appreciated, but I havent always. For a while my husband was jobless, and that put a definite strain on me.I work in a very up and down field, I can have a phenomenal week and then a shit one right after. So I guess it was less about feeling under appreciated and more about feeling a ton of stress to provide. Ive always been the breadwinner in our relationship, and I enjoy working and making good money. Actually just this year Ive opened my own business. I dont feel as respected as a breadwinner compared to a male counterpart. Many people I tell ask me how my husband feels, if hes okay with it. Some laugh, others pity me. We are happy with our dynamic and thats all that really matters. I understand you guys have a certain stance about women here.... and there are some women who fit that stereotype. But I encourage you to realize that, like men, we are all different. I dont expect huge gifts from my husband, nor did I ask for a big ring - actually I insisted we purchase fake ones. All this to say, there are great women out there. I know many. Same with men. Youre missing out on the most important human connection if you just write everyone off.
