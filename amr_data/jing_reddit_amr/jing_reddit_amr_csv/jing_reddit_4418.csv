Kinda makes me question how much of it was an 'emotional outburst' as opposed to fucking shit up because she knew she could do it and likely get away with it?,"# ::snt Kinda makes me question how much of it was an 'emotional outburst' as opposed to fucking shit up because she knew she could do it and likely get away with it?

"While I certainly do enjoy this particular video and without a doubt think she deserves it for having the gall to tell a cop she isn't going to drop her weapon, I do agree with you. The way i personally see it is that this isn't a person who thinks she will get away with it because shes a woman, it is a moment of rage. I think this is more of a ""justice served"" situation This kinda pushes the boundaries of ""pussypassdenied"" IMHO and contributes to the notion that this sub is just people who like watching women get fucked up.","# ::snt While I certainly do enjoy this particular video and without a doubt think she deserves it for having the gall to tell a cop she isn't going to drop her weapon, I do agree with you.
