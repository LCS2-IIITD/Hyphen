"Legally not justified but those twats fucking deserved it. There was a girl in my CS class in high school who liked to mess with me by digging her nails into my hand and arm, pulling on my beard and hair etc while taunting me showing that I can't do anything back to her because I would get arrested. One day I was in a shitty mood and just wanted to watch Hulu (That class was a fucking joke) so I put my headphones on and just ignored everything around me. She sat down next to me and said something to annoy me so I just said ""Fuck off, I'm not in the fucking mood"" which seemed to be code for ""Annoy me more than ever please."" and she dug her nails into my arm hard enough to draw blood and I somehow stopped myself from backhanding her in the face but instead I grabbed her wrist and just squeezed it really hard. She started screaming ""What the fuck? You're hurting me."" Security was notified and we went to talk to our principal who bitched out the girl completely while she was showing off the bruise on her wrist (It looked pretty bad tbh and I felt a little bad) but in the end he just gave us both detention. I actually have a thing for girls who scratch me, especially with fake long nails but that's only when we're fucking and not some evil little shit wanting to cause me pain and discomfort just because she can without repercussions. I know I reacted poorly technically, I should have just notified security but everyone knows how that would make me look. If it was a guy doing that to me I would obviously punch him and I'd take my -5 day suspension and it would be over but if I did that to her I know police and parents would be involved right away and I might have problems from white knights.","# ::snt Legally not justified but those twats fucking deserved it.
