"HahahahA.....joke is on you. If you are educated, and with good genetics, why the hell aren't you breeding? Hell, give em all up for adoption if you have to,to maintain your lifestyle, but please in gods name....breed. ""I'm so smart because I didn't have children"" Ya, so smart. Doesn't anyone get it? The world is made up mostly of poor people, and alot of them aren't that way just because of government corruption. These are just bad genes. These people are breeding like rabbits while you sit back and mentally masturbate about what you've done for the world. What the hell does anybody think the world is going to be populated with in years? I might as well prepare to water my lawn with Gatorade.","# ::snt HahahahA.....joke is on you.
