"This sub is turning into conspiracy . Controlled opposition safe space. The mods are compromised and % in bed with the corrupt administration of this site. I would suggest some other subs for open discussion but this is reddit. It's a lost cause. I strongly advise people to move to gab.ai, minds, etc. Voat is just more of the same (power hungry admins and mods) but with a side order of edgy trolls.","# ::snt This sub is turning into conspiracy .
