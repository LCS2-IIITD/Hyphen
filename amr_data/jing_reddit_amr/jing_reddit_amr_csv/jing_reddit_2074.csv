"I saw it stated elsewhere that one of the girl's parents are livid that this hit the national news, because they were afraid it would ""permanently damage"" their daughter. So far as I can tell, none of the girls have received any punishment whatsoever, not even from the courts (who, I don't know, might want to be very concerned about people abusing the system like these girls did). Also, the Butler Co. District Attorney for the case, Richard Goldinger, seems to have been hoping that the whole thing would disappear quietly without the public knowing about it, which may be why he was reluctant to charge the girls. Now he's in a major bind, and people are demanding answers and justice. At the very least, he no longer has the option of letting it go quietly and sweeping it under the rug.","# ::snt I saw it stated elsewhere that one of the girl's parents are livid that this hit the national news, because they were afraid it would ""permanently damage"" their daughter.
