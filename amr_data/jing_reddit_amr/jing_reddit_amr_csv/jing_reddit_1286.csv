"More like: bad things happen, they make me upset, and I'm better than the rest of you because I'm louder about it. It's become a point where voicing your opinion on social media is seen as better than actually going and helping people. Having worked in low-income areas, not a single person I worked with mentioned it on social media. The people that were so very vocal about it in the high income area I was in would never dare venture into the lower income areas around us.","# ::snt More like: bad things happen, they make me upset, and I'm better than the rest of you because I'm louder about it.
