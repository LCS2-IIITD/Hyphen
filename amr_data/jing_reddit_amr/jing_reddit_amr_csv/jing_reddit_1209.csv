"It's an easy way to feel special for kids that are decidedly plain so its pretty common. It's also an attractive option for angry kids to lay claim to a reason to be angry. Every generation has it's own version it's just this time it's impacting other people's lives and making a bit of a mockery out of the lgbt community. Last time it was all kinds of half-dragon, half-demon, half-elves trying to feel special. This time it's demiquasiboysexual that sounds suspiciously like being a straight guy or they like activities not deemed appropriate for their sex so they assume they have no gender.","# ::snt It's an easy way to feel special for kids that are decidedly plain so its pretty common.
