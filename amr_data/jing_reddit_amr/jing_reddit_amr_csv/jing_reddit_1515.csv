"From my POV, its actually got little to do with the fact that theyre women. Big men shouldnt beat on little men. Teens shouldnt beat on boys. Boys shouldnt beat on babies. Strength is for physical protection and defense, not for preserving pride. The right thing for this guy to do wasnt to wallop her, nor was it for him to stay and get hit. He was supposed to leave. Anybody who thinks this guy was in the right is a loser who misunderstands the principles of humility and civility. A man doesnt assert his strength just because he cant handle the difficult emotions of a situation. A man withstands everything he possibly can, and avoids violence at all costs.","# ::snt From my POV, its actually got little to do with the fact that theyre women.

"""Just turn your back on an attacker, bro!"" We don't like to see people bending over and taking abuse just because the attacker is a woman. So you're right. I think the key problem you're having is you think women can't do any serious damage to a man so you suggest we should just accept being physically abused by them. No, that is wrong. I don't care who you are if you attack somebody you deserve to be hit back. Either women are equal and deserve to be treated equally or women are not equal and don't deserve equal treatment. It's one or the other, if you want it both ways then save me time and just admit you want female supremacy instead of beating around the bush with appeals to chivalry and gaslighting about how ""you're not a real x if you don't do y."" I've seen every weak argument in the book about how double standards for women's benefit is a good thing.
