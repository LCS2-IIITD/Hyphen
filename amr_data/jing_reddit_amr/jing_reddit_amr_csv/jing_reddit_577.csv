"I still am having trouble with the concept of genderqueer. I used to think I was pretty easy going. Love who you want, fuck who you want, marry who you want. Gays, straights, lesbians, bisexuals, got it. I even get the people with bad body dysmorphia who went to series of psychiatrists and got hormones and surgery as soon as they could. My cousin was like that. I remember her being angry that she was a girl when she was six. Now we have transgender and gender queer. I still don't understand what a genderqueer is and why I'm now being forced to diagram out someone's sexual or gender orientation. Tell me if I'm wrong (and yes, I know I'm posting in pussy pass)...so a genderqueer would be a woman who maybe doesn't want to take hormones, but dresses like a man, thinks she is gay, and dates men? I read something about a women who identified as queer and had a boyfriend. She didn't understand why his family didn't understand that she was not a straight woman. Sorry for the long post, but I'm honestly getting confused.","# ::snt I still am having trouble with the concept of genderqueer. I used to think I was pretty easy going.
