"i honest dont understand why any man gets married in this modern age unless in the rare circumstance he marries someone who is financially better off then he. the courts can completely fuck your life up if you get a shitty judge in divorce court, basically strip your life of everything and force you to go on working else be imprisoned if you cannot keep paying an arbitrary amount. i consider it criminal that if you happen to be earning well at the point of divorce you can be court ordered to go on paying that even if you lose your job or get demoted or whatever. Marriage in the modern age offers men no security and nothing but liability Buyer beware, you will find absolutely nothing that marriage protects you from, and many things it exposes you to.","# ::snt i honest dont understand why any man gets married in this modern age unless in the rare circumstance he marries someone who is financially better off then he. the courts can completely fuck your life up if you get a shitty judge in divorce court, basically strip your life of everything and force you to go on working else be imprisoned if you cannot keep paying an arbitrary amount. i consider it criminal that if you happen to be earning well at the point of divorce you can be court ordered to go on paying that even if you lose your job or get demoted or whatever.
