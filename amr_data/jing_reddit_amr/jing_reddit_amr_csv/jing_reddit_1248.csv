"This sub is really starting to drop from an actual pussy pass sub to a women hating incel sub. Theres nothing PPD about this article. Nothing. This lady was attacked by a mentally ill man. The men on the tube with her shouldve helped her. They are cowards. Shes absolutely right. Whether they are white or not doesnt matter. Theres plenty of witnesses. They would not have been arrested for a hate crime. It doesnt make her a damsel in distress. She was a smaller person being attacked by a much larger, stronger person for no reason, and she needed help. And the men on the line did nothing. You can sit here and crack jokes about her all you want. But not being able to get laid so you talk shit on women doesnt make you more of a man. Defending this kind of shit makes you a fucking pussy just like those guys were. Just like the scumbag pussies years ago that allowed Kitty Genovese to be raped and murdered while screaming for help because they didnt want to get involved. Its disgusting. Take your fucking incel tears somewhere else.","# ::snt This sub is really starting to drop from an actual pussy pass sub to a women hating incel sub. Theres nothing PPD about this article. Nothing.
