"No one observing Remembrance Day is glorifying the war. In fact, it was because of the sacrifices of those who died in WW1 that we now consider war to be one of the worst horrors imaginable instead of something to be glorified. Prior to WW1, we had the idea that war was a glorious, noble endeavor. WW1 completely changed the world's perception of warfare, as the brutality of modern warfare effectively wiped out a generation. After WW1, the world came to truly fear and hate war, really for the first time in human history.","# ::snt No one observing Remembrance Day is glorifying the war.
