"Mark Hamill is a really good example of how, oftentimes, the man matters far more than the message, which is to say, who you hear something from matters more than what you hear. I, too, openly question some of the views he expresses on twitter, like many of you on this forum. But you know what? it doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter if he and I don't agree on anything with regards to politics, if the man himself is so obviously full of integrity and understanding, his views don't really matter, I'll listen to what he has to say. That's the real trick, if its Anita Sarkessian, it doesn't matter what the message is. If she did a video on the long term benefits of flossing, I'd probably skip picking up floss the next time I'm at the drug store and might question the very foundation of dental hygiene as a science. The messenger often matters as much, if not more so, than the message. If Anita says it, I'm not listening, period. If Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez promotes something in a campaign stop, I'm going to assume its dumb, stupid and nave and not give it a serious thought. Those people can't get through to me. If Tim Poole says it, then even if I disagree with it, he has more than enough credibility with me that I'll think about it, do some research and try to figure out where he's coming from. Hamill is one of those guys. I disagree with him on plenty, but he has a lot of credibility with me. The man is what gets people to pay attention and consider new ideas, the man often matters more than the message.","# ::snt Mark Hamill is a really good example of how, oftentimes, the man matters far more than the message, which is to say, who you hear something from matters more than what you hear.
