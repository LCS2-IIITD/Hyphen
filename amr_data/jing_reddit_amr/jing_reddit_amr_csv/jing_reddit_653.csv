Im not certain its as small a minority as you think and I believe youre downplaying how absurd the far left has become. Its more widespread and apparent then a random lunatic posting here and there. Ive been called a racist hillbilly nazi by a plethora of people on reddit simply for my username (which is just jest ) and the fact that I hold somewhat conservative political views. You see it on twitter etc all the time. Candace Owens being bashed and having racist insults thrown her way by WHITE antifa members for being a conservative. Kayne being labeled as not black because he supports trump ... those are just two quick examples. How often do you see CNN/MSNBC condemning ANTIFA ? (a self admitted stateside terrorist Group) Have you been to r/politics ? Literally just try and post something semi positive about trump or conservatives/ republicans in general ... or try to defend some ignorant meme that is put up and instead of a debate youre immediately labeled as a racist alt righter Posts are not even allowed if its in any way negative to liberals/ Obama/ Hilary etc. If you make a comment pointing out faults with the liberal establishment etc youre also called a racist nazi etc ... its quite troublesome and honestly just downright ignorant Its especially comical considering everyone just automatically assumes my race/ethnicity . The Alt-left has just gone completely bonkers. That being said I truly do hope more liberals are similar to you than the loud vocal Alt-Left groups we do often hear/witness.,"# ::snt Im not certain its as small a minority as you think and I believe youre downplaying how absurd the far left has become.

"Im not even liberal. I dont like subscribing to labels or parties because i just like being who i am. And reddit is still a minority. I really think you're also over exaggerating how populer the ""alt-left"" is. And while i don't agree with them, you can't just ignore the right's fringe group either because they're just as loud. The Alt-Right is also a huge problem like the Alt-Left. However while i wanna believe about your harassment for your name. I haven't seen that shit. At least not as a top comment which means both the harassed and harasser get downvoted at least the majority of the time. I also dont frequent r/politics for minor news. I also view r/asktrumpsupporters but i can no longet post there because i was banned for agreeing with a user when they told me i should kill myself over an opinion. I think thats why i got banned. Either way, i do listen to conservatives. My friend is a fiscal conservative. I can agree with some of his policies. I do believe social conservatism is utter garbage where a bunch of old religious people are just afraid of change and personal freedom. (Yes, abortion is a hot subject but i think the mother's decision matters more. Altho nobody gets abortion in the rd trimester where it really becomes morally wrong) I feel like I went off topic. Regardless most ppl ive met, friends, family, and bar patrons who lean left, are pretty centrist if not reasonably sensical. However, i do have to say the left are not the only path in the street nor are they the biggest. Look at every election in the past years. Its been pretty split which is honestly a good thing. One party rulings would cause chaos. Antifi really isnt that popular either. I rarely hear anything good about them aside from reddit. They're like the right's Neo Nazi problem. I feel like just like the left and everyone else you go searching for problems to validate your fears. The internet isnt the real world. Get out and meet people outside. Then you will really see people's opinions. I also live in Wisconsin, a heavy purple state now no thanks to Scott fucking Walker. Excuse me, sorry.","# ::snt Im not even liberal.

"Ok well here's some common ground. I don't hear the attacks on the extreme right by the right, similarly I don't think you hear the attacks on the extreme left by the left. Would I be right? Apparently places like twitter and facebook have algorithms that will make sure that left wing people will only see left wing views and right wing people will only see right wing views. Algorithms that go beyond simply what you like but towards what you click on. We see this with youtube, you click on one daft video then suddenly you're bombarded with similar daft videos. It's not an agenda to keep us in echo chambers but rather an agenda to keep us coming back for the content that pleases us. I would doubt that the sane right is in any way a majority but I argue FOR and against conservativism and liberalism so I see both sides of the coin so I know that we're all being played. The insane minority has a more vocal voice than the rational majority because the rational majority are just getting on with shit, life, work, bills etc. We have these surface level arguments over everything but when we get down to the nitty gritty, we both know that the powerful elites ( who have no real ideology other than power and money) are the real problems but its easier to fight Joe dickhead with his dickhead comments than it is to fight big business with their wealth and power. Simply accepting that things aren't as black and white as they appear is a massive step towards recognising that me and you, the average right and left winger, can do more together than we'll ever achieve as enemies. Even if, fundamentally we disagree on the best way to go about things, if we see each other as common citizens we'll find compromise in the middle that will give us both what we want (with concessions) without compromising our freedom to each other.","# ::snt Ok well here's some common ground.
