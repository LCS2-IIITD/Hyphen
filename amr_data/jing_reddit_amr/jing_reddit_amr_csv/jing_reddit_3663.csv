"The Greek Genocide by the Ottoman Empire is one. The Holodomor by the Soviets is another. The Cambodian Genocide. Since Genocide doesnt necessarily include killing you could include the Partition of India by the British. The Fortnite Genocide. The Eastern Timor Genocide is another but it doesnt have a wild amount of deaths, but Genocide is Genocide. There was one in Bangladesh with estimates in the millions. Then you have that some more well known ones but not talked about like the Rawandan, Armenian, and Native American genocide. Those are just the top off my head. Genocide doesnt have to include killing so some can have like dead with millions displaced.
