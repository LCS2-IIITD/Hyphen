"Lol Tucker Carlson a right winger? Why, because he's on FoxNews and talks to conservatives along with liberals? He's nowhere anywhere close to being a ""right winger"", it's just he's not far left and therefore evil in the eyes of the left. He's for more things that liberals USED to want than he is for things that conservatives want RIGHT NOW. I'm telling ya, the left is making a mistake by alienating one of the few people who could moderate on a national stage.","# ::snt Lol Tucker Carlson a right winger?
