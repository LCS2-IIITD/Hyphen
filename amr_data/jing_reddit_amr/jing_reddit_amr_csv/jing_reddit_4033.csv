"Well if true this story is kind of big deal news.

Its been over hours and yet complete silence on the matter. In this day and age that silence is highly suspicious. Furthermore this guy is asserting an outdoor gas leak at his parents house is terrorism, which is kind of a huge jump. Oh and its haloween, a night notorious for teenagers doing pranks. Also if you read down the twitter replies people are saying there were no police reports at all in his parents town. OP that I responded to immediately accused the left of doing this based pn extrapolating the evidence there already was. I mean the guy is asserting that his parents were the victims of attempted terrorism, and yet there is no news about this at all?? You don't find that odd?
