Anyone can be gay for pay. Its impossible to go hetero for dough. Now I'm actually wondering why that is. Like i've heard how women tend to be more fluid with their sexuality than men. Maybe it has to do with lesbians feeling like they have to prove their lesbianism so they don't want to do anything sexual that can be considered straight. While for straight men its not what they're into and they don't have to prove they're straight. I'm not making sense.,"# ::snt Anyone can be gay for pay. Its impossible to go hetero for dough.

I think you are thinking for the old school definition of gay. Currently orientation is an attraction to gender. Not sex. So if you are straight then you are attracted to trans women and cis women. If you are gay you are attracted to trans men and men. There is no word for all the people with vaginas except all the people with vaginas. Calling them women is transphobic and exclusive. Needing to group them at all is transphobic and exclusive. Defining people by their genitals is fetishistic and reductive. Basically if you arent trans you are trash.,"# ::snt I think you are thinking for the old school definition of gay. Currently orientation is an attraction to gender. Not sex.
