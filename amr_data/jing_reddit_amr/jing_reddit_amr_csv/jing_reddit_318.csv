">Why would a normal person seek validation from a weaker being? Incels believe they are weak. Well they are weak actually. But they could become strong. They swallowed the feminized culture and pursue a standard that was imposed on them. They grew up on feminist schools with girls who rejected them and mistreated them. Because of all the media most boys feel like incels until they lose their virginity. A lot of Chads dont realize initially they are Chads, and when they are young like before they go through similar shit. So this all comes down to male disposability and a degenerate simpish society. This is what makes men believe they are weak and that is a lost battle, they struggle against themselves and other men for a trophy that is their own slavery, its all a big lie. >Looking at it from where I am now, I was far beyond any of them in everything I did. I had more $, more degrees, a better career, and better everything else that I had EARNED. It's funny looking back at how I thought I needed their assurance. Its not hard for men to beat women at their own game in dating. In life. In work. In sports. Everything. They just need to focus on that. But incels have a point, because society being gynocentric and now giving them jobs and positions, its making the life of incels hard because meritocracy is being forgotten in place of gynocracy. Meaning it matters less to be productive and hardworking but if you are the one who knows more people and you are more feminine and submissive, and at the same time you have no honor, you have some looks, thats what will get you the job. You see? So incels are indeed fucked, but its not in dating that they are fucked, they are fucked in life, in society itself. They would be once great fathers and great providers, even great soldiers. >my ex and others would express agreement or encouragement for my successes. Looking at it from where I am now, I was far beyond any of them in everything I did. I had more $, more degrees, a better career, and better everything else that I had EARNED. Me too i experienced the same with my girlfriends. But i also noticed one thing, they barely needed to put any effort in their lives to get ahead, be that socially, professionally or at the university. They were mostly retarded, but they were priveledged for having a vagina and they dont realize that. Hopefully with the recent scenario and all the redpills in the west that might change, or else it wont be only the incels getting affected because past a certain point it becomes complete scorched earth and its all chaos, like the mouse utopia experiment.","# ::snt >Why would a normal person seek validation from a weaker being?
