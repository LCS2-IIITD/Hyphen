"As a male I really fear for the future of men. It's sad that we have become so hostile towards each other. In public, at work, at home, even just driving around I feel as if it's a matter of when, not if. I keep hearing about Patriarchy, but all I see is Matriarchy. We built this world up, now are criminalized for our gender, day by day we have less equality, and no one gives a shit. There will come a time where men will take extremes to defend themselves it will not be pretty. Just like that guy that committed suicide over a false rape accusation. How long before those men see no way out and last out violently? It's a ticking time bomb.","# ::snt As a male I really fear for the future of men.
