This is the same kind of bullshit reporting that led everybody to believe the wage-gap myth. I would expect nothing better from the shambles which is the current state of the New York Times. The comparison of mens and womens penalties as an argument that one sex or the other is being discriminated against is ridiculous. You really need to know how often they break the rules vs how often they are penalized. A comparison of that ratio for each sex would tell you if there was really any favoritism.,"# ::snt This is the same kind of bullshit reporting that led everybody to believe the wage-gap myth.
