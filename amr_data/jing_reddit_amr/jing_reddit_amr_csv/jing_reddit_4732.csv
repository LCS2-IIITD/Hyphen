"This is why I always find this bullshit funny (in a sad way), Gamers don't give a shit. Before these new outrage days, when the world was somewhat sane, I would consider gamers the most accepting of people. No one gave a crap that I was a girl, I was treated like one of the guys. And if you don't explicitly say your ""gender/race"" or get into voice chat, no one knows! I have yet to encounter someone being mean to someone because of their gender or race. I am not saying it never happens, but it is not at the rate that these sjw's make it out to be. Racism and misogyny isn't happening enough for them so they have to manufacture it. I am really getting tired of this, this is exhausting.","# ::snt This is why I always find this bullshit funny (in a sad way), Gamers don't give a shit.
