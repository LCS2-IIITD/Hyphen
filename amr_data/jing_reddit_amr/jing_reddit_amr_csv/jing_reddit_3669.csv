"I think the reason they want to flood the voterbase with people from third world countries is that st worlders are better educated, less tolerant of corruption, are attuned to the notion that the government is subordinate to the people, they're less collectivist and more individualist, and they're aware of and value their rights more than rd worlders. This makes st worlders harder to control and harder to oppress than rd worlders, since rd worlders are used to being controlled/oppressed by the state, and st worlders aren't. It's by design that our system produces people who are hostile to tyranny. That's an essential feature of our civilization. But that's an obstacle to [the powermongers in our midst.]() The st world ruling class are jealous of the rd world ruling classes because the rd world dictators have populations that are completely cowed and feel subordinate to the ruling class, which gives the ruling class absolute power. The st world ruling class want that for themselves, [so they're importing it by the boatload.]() Soon they'll have enough to outvote the original st worlders, and our ruling class will finally have the rd world dictatorship they've always dreamed of. No more public criticism, no more elections threatening their power every four years, just them, in power, forever. That's what they're striving for. That's why they're bent on importing millions of third worlders. That's why they're trying to crush any opposition to their strategy through [lies](), [censorship](), [name calling]() and [violence/intimidation.]() These are nothing less than tyrants trying to consolidate power.","# ::snt I think the reason they want to flood the voterbase with people from third world countries is that st worlders are better educated, less tolerant of corruption, are attuned to the notion that the government is subordinate to the people, they're less collectivist and more individualist, and they're aware of and value their rights more than rd worlders.
