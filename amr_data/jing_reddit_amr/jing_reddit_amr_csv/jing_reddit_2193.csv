"The feminist movement has its clutch on Latin American society so strong its sad. I was watching a video the other day where a news anchor was questioning a teenage Argentinian girl if she even knew what an abortion was, to which she never answered btw, but it seems that theyre following this movement blindly only because it seems to be the trend. My parents, being of Spaniard-Colombian descent have never witnessed such decline in Latin American culture. These countries are all losing their culture as a result of following these insane ideologies.","# ::snt The feminist movement has its clutch on Latin American society so strong its sad.
