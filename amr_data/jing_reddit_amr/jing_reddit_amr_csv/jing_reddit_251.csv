"actually who the fuck cares? if you just have a hate boner because someone disagrees with your taste in vidya, why not just say that instead of pretending you care about a technicality in an FTC guide that doesn't even have the force of law? what exactly is the ethical problem? you're acting like exactly the whinging, disingenuous, pedantic, impotent shitheads you claim to oppose.","# ::snt actually who the fuck cares? if you just have a hate boner because someone disagrees with your taste in vidya, why not just say that instead of pretending you care about a technicality in an FTC guide that doesn't even have the force of law? what exactly is the ethical problem? you're acting like exactly the whinging, disingenuous, pedantic, impotent shitheads you claim to oppose.

"> [The Guides themselves dont have the force of law.]() i think most of the things you people believe are idiotic, childish, petty, and often very delusional. in this community's short, stupid history, this battle is probably one of the more benign since there's no chance of it actually hurting anyone, and very little chance of it having any effect at all. i know those of you who are left here are too degraded and unhinged to understand that most of the games media since the beginning of the industry has primarily existed to sell games to ""wailing hyperconsumers."" Unless you're gonna talk about labor issues, the only ""reporting"" you can really do on the industry is reviews, sycophantic previews, and repeating press releases, with largely uncritical commentary sprinkled in. With these roots, what would an ethical, adversarial games press even look like? And if all of your complaints basically boil down to ""we think you're doing a poor job of making us excited to spend money on video games, and we won't visit your site anymore!"" they'll just advertise to a different crowd.

Unless you're gonna talk about labor issues, the only ""reporting"" you can really do on the industry is reviews, sycophantic previews, and repeating press releases, with largely uncritical commentary sprinkled in.
