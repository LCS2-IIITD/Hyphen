"the black male rape myth is a massive lie. we even managed to elect the biggest cuck on the planet despite his pressuring the NYPD to 'execute' a group of kids that were merely in the vicinity of a woman being raped in central park. He helped an ACTUAL rapist stay out of jail, and rape/murder numerous women. Even though the actual guy's DNA matched and he says he did it alone, Trump still thinks the kids were guilty. Isn't that fucking insane that he still got elected?
