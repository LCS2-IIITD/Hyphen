Wow you sound like a really nice and level headed person. I sure hope people you disagree with don't show up in your safe space and say things you disagree with pushing you in to a temper tantrum. For someone who uses the term snowflake so much you sure are upset about the majority of your country voting for something they believe in. I sure hope your precious and delicate sensibilities have not been too offended by a fair and functional leader elected in a fair election. Curse those libs!!! Calling them all cucks and soyboys and snowflakes has convinced me that intellectually you are superior and I must include you in all productive conversations regarding your country. I mean you're ability to trigger them liberals or call out triggered liberals is paramount to a functional democracy. I can see no way how villanizing your countrymen and carrying open hostility for someone you disagree with could possibly blow up in your face. But hey by all means if you've already convinced yourself that in a fair democracy the other opinion is to be treated as an enemy you must vanquish at all costs there was never any hope in getting through to you in the first place. You're too far gone. You think other citizens of your own country with different opinions are the enemy. And that's honestly the biggest win your actual enemies who would wish to see you harmed could have ever hoped for.,"# ::snt Wow you sound like a really nice and level headed person.
