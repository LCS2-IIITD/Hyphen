"Great wording for the topic. Better join a white supremacist group, go to Charlottesville, and shout ""JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!"" AMIRITE?! ! ! --- There exists a very legitimate discussion and critique of immigration policies in many western countries, and the mistakes some governments are making. It would've been fucking great if neo-nazis, white supremacists, and their ardent sympathizer and apologist didn't taint this whole argument such that it's becoming impossible to talk about immigration without being associated with these racist dumbasses. Good job fellas, stay classy.","# ::snt Great wording for the topic. Better join a white supremacist group, go to Charlottesville, and shout ""JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!""
