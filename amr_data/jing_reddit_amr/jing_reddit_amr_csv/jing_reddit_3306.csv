"While I myself have had some of these 'dreams' of getting fucked by some experienced woman too, let me tell you, in all honesty, this is by far nothing you should refer to with > *nice*... My brother was in such a situation, started off with him being okay with it, I mean, who in his teens would say no. But this whole sexual relationship evolves quickly into nothing that you would want to have experienced in your young years. The sex surely is good, but a year old fucking with a y/o is literally fucking his life. The woman puts pressure onto the kid, threatens him, manipulates him, does always decide only with the intention to keep the whole thing private and alive. There may came a dream true at the beginning, but this will quickly break down into a hell of problems a young kid cannot and should not deal with. And this still completly excludes the idea, that the boy doesn't actually wanted this to happen.","# ::snt While I myself have had some of these 'dreams' of getting fucked by some experienced woman too, let me tell you, in all honesty, this is by far nothing you should refer to with > *nice*...
