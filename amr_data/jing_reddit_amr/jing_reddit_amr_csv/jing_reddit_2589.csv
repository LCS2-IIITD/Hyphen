"Exactly. It's the same reason the term ""man flu"" exists - the idea that men complain more when sick and are less resilient than women when it comes to being ill, despite the fact that statistically women take more sick leave than men. It's because under the ""patriarchy"" or ""toxic masculinity"" of our society, men are expected to be stoic and tough, and any sort of indication of weakness is met with derision.","# ::snt Exactly.
