"The difference is, in the natural world most things have a chance. A coyote might eat a chick, or that chick might get to enjoy life for quite a while. In factory farming, no chick ever has any chance to have a nice life, ever, for any amount of time. Furthermore, coyotes don't have the option of using rational thought and empathy to recognize the chicks' pain and come up with a humane way to dispatch the chick. Humans DO feel empathy and we DO KNOW how to be humane, but we choose not to. Especially in certain countries. In the US, you can kill a chick or chicken fairly painfully, and with tremendous panic in the bird. In the UK, rules are more humane. This why the UK strictly regulates the nitrogen/oxygen gas mixture used to euthanize birds, so that the birds simply pass out without panic (as opposed to using a mixture or a gas that stimulates a panic response).","# ::snt The difference is, in the natural world most things have a chance.
