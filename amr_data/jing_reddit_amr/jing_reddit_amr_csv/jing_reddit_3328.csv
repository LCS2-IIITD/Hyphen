Not at all the only reason to use a fist is to assault someone. It isn't for restraint. big men had her and he needed to punch her in the face...that should be assault and he should lose his badge. No policeman should EVER punch a civilian. EVER.,"# ::snt Not at all the only reason to use a fist is to assault someone.

See that's where you are wrong. The police should NEVER Ever ever ever ever beat someone up. There should be zero chance that if you are being a cock and fighting that the police officer will just break down and start punching. If an officer can't keep a cool head and try to restrain or taze or wrap up and take down someone they should not be a cop. If the person get's banged about taking them down when they resist OK that's their own fault but that cop should never just start punching. That shows they have lost control.,"# ::snt See that's where you are wrong. The police should NEVER Ever ever ever ever beat someone up.
