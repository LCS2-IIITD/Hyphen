"I didn't address her behavior. Nor did I defend it. You are arguing a point I never made. Weird of you to do so. My point was simple - this article does nothing to disprove William's assertion which was that women are penalized for less abusive behavior than men on average. As for your evidence, you're right, I don't care. I don't care because anecdotal evidence is literally useless. Your anecdotal evidence is as stupid as her single example. That's why I said you need a statistical analysis looking at the specific words and reasons why players are penalized for verbal abuse.","# ::snt I didn't address her behavior. Nor did I defend it.
