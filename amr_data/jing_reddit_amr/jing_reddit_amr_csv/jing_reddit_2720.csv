I prefer nudity because cloths can be uncomfortable but thats not the worse. The sound or feeling of things rubbing against lenticular plastic (the ridge plastic that gives thing d effects) drives me up the wall. My back tingle just by the thought and its extremely unpleasent. A few other sounds causes the same effect like metal scraping metal.,"# ::snt I prefer nudity because cloths can be uncomfortable but thats not the worse.
