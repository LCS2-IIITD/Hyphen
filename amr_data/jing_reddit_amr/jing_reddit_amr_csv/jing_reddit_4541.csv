"That they're an idiot. All weapons by their very nature are egalitarian because they have no way of discriminating themselves in who can use them. Hell, the Gun as an invention may actually be one of the most egalitarian weapons since modern fire-arms don't require that much skill to use effectively in their purpose. Sure, not everyone's a gunslinger or marksman, and you need to know better than to fire a .50 cal at full auto well holding it, but you don't need to be a master to use a gun effectively.","# ::snt That they're an idiot.
