">But thats not all she found. Her data also shows how few people are actually needed to topple any government. Rather than the previously accepted percent of the population, it turns out you only need a mere percent of all citizens onboard to rid yourself of a tyrannical leader posting this, because it seems to me as if you are implying that % is a number that should be too small to matter. When it fact, it's huge in given context. The Nazi party had support of % and they came pretty close to taking the world by force. And if you look at above link, it also notes that 'peaceful' revolutions as in those that push their ideology without actual violence are times more likely to succeed. (50% success rate vs. % for the violent revolutions) And than once we consider that those % are highly concentrated in control of education, social sciences and media, and their goal is not in fact an actually revolution but merely to gradually steer society in a different direction... it's just really inaccurate to portray that as somehow less than significant","# ::snt >But thats not all she found.
