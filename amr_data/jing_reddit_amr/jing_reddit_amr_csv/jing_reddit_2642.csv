"Dudes, there is no way in hell that % of the people saying they would do this would last even one ~~day~~ morning picking cotton even if you paid double that wage. Source: I picked one yard row of cotton on my grandparents farm while I was a HS athlete in a AAAA school lettering in Football and Wrestling. It wrecked me and I had to stay in bed the next day. An experienced picker will do something like a dozen rows a day. It really sucks and is extremely painful. There's a reason that in the south 'cotton pickin' is used as a fairly strong obscenity. Edit: Check this article out on CO farmers trying to use US workers even when the unemployment rate was pretty high (8.5%) and paying them $10.50 an hour (pretty good for rural areas): Most of them skedaddled before lunch.","# ::snt Dudes, there is no way in hell that % of the people saying they would do this would last even one ~~day~~ morning picking cotton even if you paid double that wage.

"They're paid more than that, but still low. It's rising though. Farm work is actually either extremely skilled or semi-skilled work. It's just that Mexico has been mechanizing their agriculture over the last several decades and that has been driving peasants off their land, leading to a surplus of skilled workers. IMO, fifty years from now pickers will probably be paid on a level similar to Nurses if not doctors - automation will mean fewer of them, but they'll be paid a lot more. There's a chance that Africa won't be through mechanizing yet and this sub will be freaking about about all the Kenyan H2Bs coming in to pick stuff and bitching about the good old days of the 'mercian Mexicans coming in.","# ::snt They're paid more than that, but still low.
