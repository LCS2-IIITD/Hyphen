"What I love in the comments is everyone calling the guy a jackass (my paraphrase) because he wouldn't give up porn. It's almost like the didn't read his response of ""You are more important to me than porn, but I will not allow myself to be manipulated in this way."" The dude didn't love porn, he hated emotional blackmail. Replace ""porn"" with damn near anything (with a few notable drug related exceptions) and his response was the correct one. ""Johnny, you are a meth addict and its ruining our lives. You have to pick, me or the meth"" ""Johnny, you are a car thief and it's going to get you killed. You have to pick, me or stealing cars."" ""Johnny, you like to yank your crank while looking at naked women. I don't like it. You need to pick, me or pictures of naked women."" *sings* one of these things is not like the other...","# ::snt What I love in the comments is everyone calling the guy a jackass (my paraphrase) because he wouldn't give up porn.
