They're claiming women are entitled to shorter work weeks because they spend more time doing domestic chores at home. Bull-fucking-shit! I never had kids but both my ex wives left almost all of the housework to me. Their cars were always dirty and full of trash. They were quite content to let the house go to hell rather than pitch in and help. Hell the last one could barely be convinced to turn on the fucking Roomba. All you had to do was hit a damn button. Apparently that sort of thing was beneath their dignity. Looking back the only women I've ever known who could be bothered to clean were born prior to the s.,"# ::snt They're claiming women are entitled to shorter work weeks because they spend more time doing domestic chores at home.
