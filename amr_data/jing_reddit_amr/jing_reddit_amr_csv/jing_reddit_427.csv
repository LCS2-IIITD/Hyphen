"This is pretty much the inevitable consequences of what happens when the you don't *earn* your rights but they are *given* to you.

Thus you don't really care about the consequences of something you never really earned and fuck shit up because you don't know how to use it.

You knew that even if you break them you just have to throw a temper tantrum and they'll buy you new ones so you can shut up. Things change drastically when you grow up and have to work, value and buy your own stuff.

Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
