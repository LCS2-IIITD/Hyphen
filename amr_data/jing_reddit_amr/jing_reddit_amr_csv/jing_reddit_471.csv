"> not a money-making endeavor It turns out that little of what Netflix does is a sustainable business model. As much as Hollyweird deserves our scorn, their business models are based on over a century of hard learned failure and success. Netflix represents what happens when a bunch of Sand Hill and Wall Street MBAs imagine they've figured out a better way that no one's ever thought of before (which of course involves selling a metric fuckton of debt to the street with little hope of face value redemption, but hey, it's all for a good cause, right...)","# ::snt > not a money-making endeavor It turns out that little of what Netflix does is a sustainable business model.
