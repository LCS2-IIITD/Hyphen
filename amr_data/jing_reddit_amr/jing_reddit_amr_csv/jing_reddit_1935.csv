"Sam Hyde's style gave me a lot of insight on how to approach these people. The point is that the best way to argue with them is by using what I would call philosophical judo. Understand that this is a culture war. You don't win by being thorough and right. You win by making your side look cool and by exposing the toxicity of your opponent. Personally, I almost always false flag these days.
