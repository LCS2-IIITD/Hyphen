"You can lean left all you want as long as you come back to a sensible middle with people on the right. It seems to me that the people on the right have basically stayed that way for the past years all while people on the left are getting further and further to the left. It's causing them to be more belligerent and militarised, example being forming lunch (Lynch) mobs to attack republicans at restaurants and at their personal homes. I don't see a single group of people on the right forming mobs and going to Corey Booker's house","# ::snt You can lean left all you want as long as you come back to a sensible middle with people on the right.
