">I really don't give a shit what you've seen You also don't care about reality. In addition to that, the incident had nothing to do with her being a woman and everything to do with throwing around political weight.

Peace be upon you brother.","# ::snt >I really don't give a shit what you've seen You also don't care about reality.
