"Assassin's Creed is complete fiction. Nobody would be surprised at a Spartan Warrior Princess or hell even a fucking AMAZON, a literal mythological warrior woman with one breast missing for historical accuracy and to better shoot a bow. Now depicting the Russo-Japanese war with armies on both sides with women in it... you are stepping on some serious toes now. Historical toes. Very sensitive toes that have been hit with many hammers like black Legionaries and black British Queens. &;","# ::snt Assassin's Creed is complete fiction.
