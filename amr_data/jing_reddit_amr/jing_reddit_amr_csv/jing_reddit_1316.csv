"I remember before women were in the workforce in the numbers they are now, they were slapping themselves on the back about how less they drink and how healthier and happier they are, as if men are weak and just naturally less healthy and more reckless with lifestyle etc. and looks what happened, when women start having to work low and behold they drink more and less happy and are having a crisis. suck it up buttercup. zero fucking sympathy, this is the world you wanted there is no going back now.","# ::snt I remember before women were in the workforce in the numbers they are now, they were slapping themselves on the back about how less they drink and how healthier and happier they are, as if men are weak and just naturally less healthy and more reckless with lifestyle etc. and looks what happened, when women start having to work low and behold they drink more and less happy and are having a crisis. suck it up buttercup. zero fucking sympathy, this is the world you wanted there is no going back now.
