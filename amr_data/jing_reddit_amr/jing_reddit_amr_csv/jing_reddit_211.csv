"The reasons I hate old people I don't know are: . They're never wrong. Some old asshole just pulled out in front of you and you had to slam on the breaks? Your fault. You were driving the speed limit too fast. . Waiting in line at a register behind an old lady? Good luck staying sane while she tries to make small chat about grandkids instead of writing her check out. Yes, check, which she will take forever to write out. Then she will take forever checking every single bag to make sure everything is there because she wasn't paying attention while it was being bagged. Then she'll take forever to move the bags and her check book so the next person can pay for their groceries. . Did an old person do something rude like stop in the entryway of a gas station so she can scratch her loto ticket? Did you say excuse me only for her to completely ignore you? Listen to her angrily say ""excuse you"" as you try to enter the building like it's your fault she chose the single worst place to just stop and be completely absorbed in herself. Basically old people are rude, entitled, slow, extremely distracted, and arrogant.","# ::snt The reasons I hate old people I don't know are: . They're never wrong.
