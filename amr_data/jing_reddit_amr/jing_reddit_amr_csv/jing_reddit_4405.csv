"Well, he got a full-time job at Waypoint, for one. I'm not familiar with Rob Zacny from before, but from listening to him talk about his personal history, I get the impression that he was perhaps once a conservative through his parents, but like Patrick Klepek, at some point became ""woke"" and went as far Left as possible, though he still likes military subject matter. And unlike Klepek, he's actually book-smart to a degree, more like Austin Walker.","# ::snt Well, he got a full-time job at Waypoint, for one.
