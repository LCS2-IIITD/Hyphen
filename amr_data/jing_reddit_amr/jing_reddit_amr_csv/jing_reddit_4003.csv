"""But I don't want penis on penis action"" is backwards reasoning? Jokes aside, it has somewhat of a point, if it is just about what you feel regarding aesthetic appeal - if I find some girl hot and then find out she is trans, I would probably still feel she is hot, it is being objective, but I'd not want to take it further. If it is about ""you stop wanting to go all the way"" kinda attraction shaming, then, no, bad post.","# ::snt ""But I don't want penis on penis action"" is backwards reasoning?
