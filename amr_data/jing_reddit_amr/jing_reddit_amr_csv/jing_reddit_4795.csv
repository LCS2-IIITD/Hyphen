"Disclaimer: I have never been addicted to opioids and can only relate through people I know who struggled with their addictions. That said, some years ago I really, really hurt my back. It started on a drive from South Carolina to Indiana (for those not in the U.S. that's a bit longer than the distance from London to Frankfurt, Germany). By the time we got into Indiana, I couldn't walk. Had to ask some stranger at a rest stop to walk me into the bathroom and prop me up while I peed. My doctor put me on a stack of muscle relaxers and a somewhat-stronger Vicodin derivative. Point is, I understand how you could get addicted to that. The feeling was just so good. If I had any idea how to get that combo illegally I might still be popping them. Fortunately, my doctor cut me off. It's a truly frightening thought. If a measure gets addicts treatment, I'm generally all for it.","# ::snt Disclaimer: I have never been addicted to opioids and can only relate through people I know who struggled with their addictions.
