"The toothpaste can't be put back in the tube, so why bother complaining about it? As a matter of fact, I'm happy that women are independent now because the pressure to get married has eased since a couple of generations ago. Let them work themselves haggard and become alcoholics like men used to, so what? I'm just happy that they're all paying fucking incomes taxes now (and explains why government has always been pro-feminism: more income tax revenues!).","# ::snt The toothpaste can't be put back in the tube, so why bother complaining about it?
