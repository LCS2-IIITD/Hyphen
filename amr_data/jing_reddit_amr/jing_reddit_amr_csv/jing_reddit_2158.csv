"Konosuba is an interesting case because everyone in the world except for maybe Vanir is completely fucking useless as an existence, since the whole LN is comedic at its core with a slight slice of romance. For every instance of Kazuma going full Al Bundy on one of his retarded team mates, you also have Kazuma getting killed, eaten, imprisoned, or actually having to fess up to his own bullshit. It's a world with equality. Also, the girls actually have redeeming qualities (except for Aqua) and stand by Kazuma when it counts, even if they have severe reservations because it's Kazuma, because he puts up with all the rest of their shit.","# ::snt Konosuba is an interesting case because everyone in the world except for maybe Vanir is completely fucking useless as an existence, since the whole LN is comedic at its core with a slight slice of romance.
