"well I have brown skin and I am a shit singer on the shower but I prefer chile spicy over spice spicy so no, completely sure not an indian although I agree the culture of nailing husbands to the wall is similar. On the case above the guys resulted to be actually decent and likeable, but they are still poor. i never went MGTOW in the sense its a relatively new term to me. I simply decided out of my own to focus on myself rather than waste money on girls and dating. When I actually went on dates I had some rules I religiously followed. - Make sure you can have fun alone on the date if she doesnt show up or simply dont like each other. For example watch a movie you will like regardless if you are with company. - Think how much you would spend alone, if the date goes well you can increase the amount but only if she agrees to be the one paying the second time. - Kisses and sex early, if she wants to wait for whatever reason its ok, dont push it. The best way to not push it is to stop dating. - Make sure she knows you dont want an stable relationship in a natural way. she will bring the subject 'casually' so just answer equally 'casually'. - Spend at least the same time and money on fun as you spend improving yourself, fun includes fun alone and dating. I have many good stories to tell on how I learned and applied each lesson, maybe will sometime. I dont date anymore because I am living with a girl who doesnt want to get married and knows I will literally flee the country if she tries to nail me. She also has an extreme case of tokophobia and she would literally gag if she sees a pregnant woman so pregnancy is less likely. I am more afraid of the girls at work to be honest, I know some of them hate me for being an insuferable asshole in charge of making sure they dont mess up code. I have adopted personal policies of only calling their attention on bad code when my boss is present, never mentor them alone and only talk to them through corporate email.","# ::snt well I have brown skin and I am a shit singer on the shower but I prefer chile spicy over spice spicy so no, completely sure not an indian although I agree the culture of nailing husbands to the wall is similar.
