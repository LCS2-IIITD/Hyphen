">As someone who has worked retail, I genuinely hate how customers behave Right, and that's my point. It's not the same as hating every single person that walks in the door, and judging them negatively *because* they came in. It would be like working at CVS, and seeing someone walk in and assume they were a crackhead or a hobo *because they walked into CVS*. It's not so much an anti ""the customer is always right"" attitude. It's a ""there are never customers who are right"" attitude.","# ::snt >As someone who has worked retail, I genuinely hate how customers behave Right, and that's my point.
