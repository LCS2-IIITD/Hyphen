"I'm sure there will be, there's already been a huge overreaction to it. A bunch of people in /r/anime were *literally shaking* after the first episode. Nothing should be off limits in fiction but I'm sure the usual suspects can't wait to talk about how this show means Japan is encouraging rape culture or something. EDIT: Before anyone else responds, I will say that lots of people seemed to like the episode. But there was still a sizeable amount of pearl clutching.","# ::snt I'm sure there will be, there's already been a huge overreaction to it.
