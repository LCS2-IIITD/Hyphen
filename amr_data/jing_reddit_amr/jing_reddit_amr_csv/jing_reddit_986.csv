"No, it's really not. Here's what happened (speaking as someone on the left). I think about a decade or so ago, things were by and large much more liberal. People were focused on more individual level diversity, breaking down expectations placed on people, letting people choose their own path in life. That sort of thing. (As an example, universal health care is touted as making it easier for people to open up businesses). But over the last decade or so, things have changed. I think the left has moved away from being liberal, and is now more progressive. And there IS a distinct difference. The former is about freedom and choice and individuality, and the latter is about results and statistics and ratios. Now, I don't think that's permanent. I think a big part of that is because progressivism (especially something like Critical Theory) plays VERY well in (now , but the same idea goes) characters. And a LOT of effort goes into covering up the idea that there's ""two lefts"". Including, I might add, the opposition to GamerGate. Liberalism and Progressivism are simply not the same thing. They don't go together at all. Now, there might be some similarities, but where they're coming from and how to get there tend to be entirely different.","# ::snt No, it's really not.
