"Yup, you should see the feminists in Finland and their official stance regarding the fact that we have conscription for men. ""Uhhh well if it's a problem you should just get rid off it. Also women's service should remain as voluntary and with higher pay because womanly needs."" The solution is never to extend responsibilities to women or heaven forbid give those who served a compensation so they can catch up in studies or work, at most they ""allow"" men to stop doing something unequal that is mentioned. Let's just ignore Russia and pull down our defenses like Sweden did, ignoring the fact that they only could do so because we're the buffer zone...","# ::snt Yup, you should see the feminists in Finland and their official stance regarding the fact that we have conscription for men.
