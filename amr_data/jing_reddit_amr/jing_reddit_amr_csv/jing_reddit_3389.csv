"Hahaha oh my god the arrogance. How many PC gamers do you know own a flagship $800+ phone? I don't know many. Even I use a $100 stripped down Samsung as my daily driver. It does video well and is half way decent at running all my apps. Which, by the way DOESN'T FUCKING INCLUDE ONE GOD DAMN GAME. I own the equivalent of a Chevy malibu for a phone. Why? Because mobile games are shit, will always be shit and I'm sorry, but I'm not gaming for hours on end on a inch screen with touchscreen controls. I'd rather play on a switch, you know, something that is designed for extended hours of mobile gaming? Oh, and don't get me started on the constant ads and microtransactions that plague the mobile phone gaming market. I have a decent gaming PC. I spent thousands to future proof it for at least years. I'm not about to run out and buy a god damn new phone just so I can play what will most likely be a shit fest of a game. I really hate the way the gaming market seems to be going in. All they care about is money money money and it's blatantly obvious they are castrating the good developers who are with these mega game companies.","# ::snt Hahaha oh my god the arrogance.
