"Hah, ***no***! They're both united by their love for Peter Parker, actually. Unrequited homosexual in Eddie Brock's case, spurned symbiosexual in the sapient alien goo's case. It's absolutely obvious to anyone who understands their coding!

It really *was* deeply interested in being his, and his alone, and Brock was an ally of convenience.)","# ::snt Hah, ***no***! They're both united by their love for Peter Parker, actually.

"> venom isn't supposed to be some ruthless psychopath that kills indiscriminately imo He's not in the comics, he's an anti-hero who's got a grudge against Spiderman for screwing him over, Brock has a similar motivation and as a result they fuse and their desire for vengeance fuels them. Venom isn't supposed to be this heroic incarnation they've stuck together from spare parts. He's supposed to be self interested and only sides with Spiderman out of convenience. In this film he's basically just a hero trying to save the world for selfless reasons. The movie should've been R as well considering the amounts of violence in the comics, Venom is supposed to literally eat people's heads. It doesn't even really matter if you don't want to be totally devoted to aligning with comic lore but they've departed so much from the subject matter that they've essentially made an entirely new thing that's hardly like Venom in the comics. How do they play this off anyway with more Venom comics? Do they just ignore this movie and keep making the same thing or do they decide they're going to ignore years of comics involving the interplay between Spiderman and Venom in favor of this Sony amalgamation? Probably the former. So when some kid goes and tries to get a Venom comic because he liked the movie he's either going to be confused or annoyed, possibly both. Venom is a pussy because he's said to be one in the movie, he admits that he's one of the weaker symbiotes. In the comics (and the TV show for that matter) he's basically one of a few of Spiderman's arch-nemeses as a result of his past host with Spiderman, allowing him to give his host the powers of Spiderman and prevent Spiderman from detecting Venom with his spider sense. Also depending on which host you're talking about Venom is either weaker than some other Symbiotes or much stronger. Hell even Eddie Brock once fought and beat Superman in a crossover comic and still held his own when Superman and Spiderman worked together. Venom even fought on even footing with Juggernaut. This also divorces the Venom lore from the very recent comics involving Knull which is a whole other thing altogether. The real reason they made this shit movie is Sony needed to churn something out so they keep a hold on a bit of their Marvel licenses that they haven't let lapse.","# ::snt > venom isn't supposed to be some ruthless psychopath that kills indiscriminately imo He's not in the comics, he's an anti-hero who's got a grudge against Spiderman for screwing him over, Brock has a similar motivation and as a result they fuse and their desire for vengeance fuels them.

I mentioned that and if you read my comment you would know what I said about it. it was very one dimensional especially for a character comprised of minds... >Venom isn't supposed to be this heroic incarnation they've stuck together from spare parts. the movie version isn't that LMAO. he's still an anti hero... they wrapped up the movie with him EATING criminals... ? thats something an antihero would do not a hero. >He's supposed to be self interested and only sides with Spiderman out of convenience. In this film he's basically just a hero trying to save the world for selfless reasons. are you sure that you watched the right movie? venom didn't save the world for selfless reasons... he saved them for pretty selfish reasons... he LIKED it here lmao. he'd rather let all his alien buddys rot out in space and live like a king on earth snacking on fresh flesh with an actual body at his disposal. LMAO. and you called him SELFLESS? lol. yeah it would've worked better if it was R but sony are pussy's. what do you want me to do about it? hate what was a pretty decent action movie about characters I like with actors I like? not gonna happen. >Venom is supposed to literally eat people's heads have you even seen the fucking movie? because he does... and in fact if I recall one of Tom Hardy's lines is ""YOU JUST ATE THAT GUYS HEAD"" ... > but they've departed so much from the subject matter that they've essentially made an entirely new thing that's hardly like Venom in the comics. HE STILL EATS PEOPLE'S HEADS!?!?!? YOU CLEARLY HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE AND DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. lmao. bye felicia.","# ::snt >He's not in the comics, he's an anti-hero who's got a grudge against Spiderman for screwing him over, Brock has a similar motivation and as a result they fuse and their desire for vengeance fuels them. right.
