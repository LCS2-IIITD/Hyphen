"Apparently it's stupid and racist to cast Huntress as a white woman, because the character is currently Black in the comics (and it's completely irrelevant that the character *wasn't* originally). However, it's *also* stupid to complain about them race-swapping Black Canary and it doesn't matter that she's white in the comics. Yeah, I'd say fair enough that the reaction to all this is pretty telling, or at least, *The Mary Sue*'s reaction is pretty telling.","# ::snt Apparently it's stupid and racist to cast Huntress as a white woman, because the character is currently Black in the comics (and it's completely irrelevant that the character *wasn't* originally).
