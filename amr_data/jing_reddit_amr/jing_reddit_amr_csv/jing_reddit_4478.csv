"I might normally agree with you on the black vs. white issue and why people are talking shit about her, but the surveillance video shows the kid barely brush past her and she quite obviously starts taunting him and thrusting her crotch at him and acting like an all around lunatic, and doesn't call the cops until his mother came up and said something to her. She then proceeds to sit on the phone with saying the kid ""grabbed"" her ass, there is no way she mistook his backpack barely grazing her as an ass grab. Also, the kid is . Even if he had grabbed her, how she reacted was sick. I'm also not of the belief that we should just ""believe women"" instantly the second they make a claim, so there's that. But the reason people who do think that way are ""attacking"" this woman is because she is clearly a cunt who called to be spiteful after she started openly harassing a kid who innocently, unknowingly brushed her with his backpack when he walked past, and his mother told her to cut it out. The public apology is a PR move and after the way she acted means nothing and certainly wasn't sincere. If she was truly apologetic she wouldn't have acted how she did to start with.","# ::snt I might normally agree with you on the black vs. white issue and why people are talking shit about her, but the surveillance video shows the kid barely brush past her and she quite obviously starts taunting him and thrusting her crotch at him and acting like an all around lunatic, and doesn't call the cops until his mother came up and said something to her.
