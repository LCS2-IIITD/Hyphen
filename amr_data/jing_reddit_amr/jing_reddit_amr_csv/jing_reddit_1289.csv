"Encouragement is great. I've seen campaigns by female celebrities doing coding and trying to show that its ""cool"" for girls to do too. Just like campaigns trying to get men to talk about their feelings are great too. Giving a financial advantage and access to some of the most prominent people in the tech industry just because you're a woman isn't that. It's clear discriminition. In addition to this, the people recieving scholarships are far and away women who would likely be going into tech anyway. Giving very little benefit to the cause (even though the cause of getting more women in tech is one I agree with). Scholarships should only be given out based on either academic merit or financial circumstance.","# ::snt Encouragement is great.
