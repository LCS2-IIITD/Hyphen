Oh it is. My mom walked out on my family and the courts ordered her to pay $87 a month for my brother i was already . My uncle on the other hand was ordered to pay a month. They are both master plumbers who make -60 a year. My uncle lost his business and is in serious trouble with the IRS because of his financial burden. My dad used the used the a month to take my brother to dinnner once a month at this italian restaurant we all used to go to. It was his way of keeping order. My brother is now (im ) and they still do it. Makes him happy.,"# ::snt Oh it is. My mom walked out on my family and the courts ordered her to pay $87 a month for my brother i was already .
