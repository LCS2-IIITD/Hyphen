"Update: Comedian Owen Benjamin was just banned from livestreaming on Youtube because of a community violation for showing ""pornography"" - the ""porn"" in question was a clip of Bonobo monkeys having sex, and was a clip (from YouTube) of a documentary by David Attenborough. Shit is getting real. My original post: I think at some point the left wing/sjw cencorship in the tech world is going to naturally (edit: lead us to) two seperate online worlds; one that tolerates free speech and one that doesn't: FB, Reddit, Youtube are all turning into ""big brother"" It's time to start planning an eventual exodus (edit: to more tolerant platforms) and using social media to turn it into a mass movement. Edit: For those who are not understanding my post: the people that care about freedom of speech need to migrate AWAY from repressive platforms TO platforms that SUPPORT free speech and non politically correct ideas. FB, Twitter, Youtube, AND Reddit are NOT committed to free speech/ideas anymore.... and I think that they are only going to get more oppresssive and restrictive as tme goes by. Tlr It's looks like it's time for large numbers of freedom loving users to move to social media platforms that support free speech. Reddit is no longer one of those places.","# ::snt Update: Comedian Owen Benjamin was just banned from livestreaming on Youtube because of a community violation for showing ""pornography"" - the ""porn"" in question was a clip of Bonobo monkeys having sex, and was a clip (from YouTube) of a documentary by David Attenborough.
