"Woman here. Fuck bitches like this, especially this one. Who tries to up support by k?! A month?! My ex pays me one dollar a month. You read that right. One dollar. He only pays that because I have sole physical custody, and that dollar gives me the right to claim my son on my tax return. He never has or will. That's because he realizes raising his son takes time and effort, as well as money. He supplies everything he needs- haircuts, school clothes, lunch money- and when he was younger, we even went in on Santa gifts together, regardless of whose house he spent Christmas morning at. He does all of his pickup and drop off on his weekends without (much) complaint. It's about my son, and the fact he's raised right. Not about money. a month is a big paycheck already. This bitch is crazy. DENIED.","# ::snt Woman here. Fuck bitches like this, especially this one. Who tries to up support by k?! A month?! My ex pays me one dollar a month. You read that right.
