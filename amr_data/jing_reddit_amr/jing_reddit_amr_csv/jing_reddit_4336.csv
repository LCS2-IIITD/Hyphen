"I thought the idea of toxic masculinity was that there are aspects of masculinity that are toxic to men (I.e. ""just rip out the asbestos tiles, an N95 dust mask is plenty of PPE). Whereas toxic whiteness is the idea that whites are toxic in general. Correct me if I'm wrong? Because I do think that men screw themselves over sometimes by trying to be masculine, so I agree with the notion of toxic masculinity, but I don't agree that all whites are toxic because obviously that ideology is fucking toxic","# ::snt I thought the idea of toxic masculinity was that there are aspects of masculinity that are toxic to men (I.e.
