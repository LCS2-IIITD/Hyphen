"""in what world"" yes, I what world does this happen? You know what I find crazy, living in a world where women hate men just for acting like men, where women assault men for no other reason than ""they have a penis"", where women will take a man to court and can claim rape for consensual sex she regretted later and even after been proven wrong (hopefully) she still has hundreds of supporters, living in a world where women hate how men spread there legs SO MUCH that some of them will physically attack the man doing it, even going as far as to pour bleach on their crotches Edit: disregard the specific account of assault about the bleach thing because it's unclear whether it's true or not so I'm just going to treat it like it's not, we all happy, good","# ::snt ""in what world"" yes, I what world does this happen?
