"IDC what you fantasized about at that age, it's incredibly cringy how you think you developed at a somehow perfect age in a perfect way and that another child is 'fucking retarded' for being different. If you're that unable to empathize with the boy because he's male, imagine the same scenario with a year old girl and a year old man. It's fucking disgusting to prey on children.","# ::snt IDC what you fantasized about at that age, it's incredibly cringy how you think you developed at a somehow perfect age in a perfect way and that another child is 'fucking retarded' for being different.
