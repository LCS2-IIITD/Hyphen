Are you jealous of Monica, do you wish to be in Monicas place? I'm honestly curious, because I can't fathom why anyone would care about who a person fucks when its LEGAL. What's next, are you going to put on a pope hat and talk about adultery? Who the F care. I will say this though, if you continue on with this line of reasoning, rather than voting straight Republican in mid terms, I'll vote Democrat. You just convinced someone to vote AGAINST you out of shear spite. Get it through your skull people fuck, its none of your business. It becomes your business in rape or pedophilia that can be proven.
