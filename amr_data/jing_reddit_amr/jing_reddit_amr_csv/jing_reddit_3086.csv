"> There are significant antitrust issues with these actions. Gab has recourse. You need to break out of the paradigm that resorting to the courts is the way to seek redress. The rule of law is dead. D E A D. The way those in charge of enforcing the laws concerning confidential information excused and ignored the obvious nefarious deeds of Hillary Clinton should have been your wake up call. Now, it is all about what allies you can muster to your side. The far left has nearly all of the tech sector. What does their opposition have? A bunch of smaller sites, hoping to grow but secretly terrified of drawing the ire of the media-tech oligarchy. That **has** to change, otherwise bullets *will* start flying. The *only* way it will change is if the biggest oligarchy on the planet (government) jerks the media-tech oligarchy up short by their neck.","# ::snt > There are significant antitrust issues with these actions.
