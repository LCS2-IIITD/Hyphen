"Meh. Political bullshit. Macron's party is happy to light counterfires to avoid talking about the hot topics right now, and Melenchon is a self-centered clown pretending to care for the masses who just happened to make a gigantic ass out of himself even more so than usual. Don't get me wrong, I voted for Macron, but he has stuff to fix before I'm happy I did it. This is not helpful.","# ::snt Meh. Political bullshit.

"By ""barrage"", I take it you're reffering to the second turn, where everybody voted against Le pen, rather than for Macron ? Wrong call. I voted for the other guy because I believe her ideas are uninteresting, when his had.. very slight potential, not because of ""making a barrage"". Even if I deem the FN ideas (or should I call it the RN now ?) completely bonkers, I support their right for speech, especially as demonizing them is the best way to bring them support. Let those ideas be discussed on the marketplace of thought and voted upon.","# ::snt By ""barrage"", I take it you're reffering to the second turn, where everybody voted against Le pen, rather than for Macron ?
