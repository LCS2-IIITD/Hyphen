I have very mixed feelings about this because on one hand ISIS is horrible and needs to be erased but on the other do we really want a system where they punish the family members because of what their husband or father did? Like would it have been appropriate to kill all of the German SS's wives because of their involvement in the holocaust?,"# ::snt I have very mixed feelings about this because on one hand ISIS is horrible and needs to be erased but on the other do we really want a system where they punish the family members because of what their husband or father did?
