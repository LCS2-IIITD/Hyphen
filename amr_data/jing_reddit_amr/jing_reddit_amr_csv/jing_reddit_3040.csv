"No need to throw insults. Regarding patriotism it would have to be defined in a way that dont enter in conflict with teamwork and cooperation or the principles of the enlightenment, and usually isnt defined that way (neither nationalism). We could enter a deep discussion about the meaning of the word country and its relationship with culture, and therefore how patriotism would have to be defined to not considering other people in other countries less of a priority or how loving your country wouldnt imply loving other people less, we would also have to question ourselves if an abstract concept (or a physical piece of land or territory) do deserve to be loved as well to agree on the differences between patriotism and nationalism. In any case I much prefer a single culture based on the principles of the enlightenment than different cultures (different countries), of course a single culture isnt how the world is right now, but I prefer to defend what I think would be good rather than defend an imperfect existing model just because it is under the attack of an even worse model. The problem with trying to associate a movement with many other things that are not part of it and calling anyone who disagree with a few of them retarded (some people would acuse you of ableism for that) is that people arent going to be convinced by that nor are going to take you seriously for that matter. A big problem with feminism is that is an ideology that convinces people that whoever dont agree with them completely are deeply morally/ethically flawed, and therefore their ideas and opinions can be discarded without consideration. Your approach is much the same, you also consider yourself as in possession of the truth, the main difference is that you consider anyone who disagrees with you, even if only on a few things on a long list, as mentally impaired (and therefore their opinions can be discarded too). Btw, ad hominems are logical fallacies.","# ::snt No need to throw insults.
