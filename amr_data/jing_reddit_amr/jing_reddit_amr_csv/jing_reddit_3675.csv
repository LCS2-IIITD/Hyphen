"Well, its certainly PPD. I would say the sentence is too harsh, because well, it is. You can get wasted and drive a car into a field of children and not get a life sentence.

Although I wouldn't exactly elevate the court system indiscriminately completely fucking people over as some sort of positive ideal.","# ::snt Well, its certainly PPD.
