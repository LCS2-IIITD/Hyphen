"I'm married and the only other men in my life are my Dad and my friends. Putting others down doesn't elevate you any higher, do you realise that? How do I not have dignity? Not a single one of the men in my life acts superior to me. They all support me, teach me things, make me feel good and make me ridiculously happy. The ONLY people I have had issues with are women who are bitchy, put each other down, get jealous over nothing and act like entitled princess babies instead of grown respectable women. Pardon my French but you are a massive cunt and I'd be willing to bet the reason you hate men is because you feel NEGLECTED by them because you have zero redeeming features to make a man want to give you the time of day. Go take a long hard look in the mirror because I doubt the creature looking back at you is very attractive, outside AND inside.","# ::snt I'm married and the only other men in my life are my Dad and my friends.

Then block the subreddit? Or scroll past and save yourself the headache? Do you just click on everything on r/all just to give your thoughts on it? Because that's kinda retarded if that's how you Reddit. I bet you find your day a little easier if you just ignore and block things that piss you off. People might be a little less hostile too if you weren't actively inserting yourself just to say things that you know will piss them off.,"# ::snt Then block the subreddit?
