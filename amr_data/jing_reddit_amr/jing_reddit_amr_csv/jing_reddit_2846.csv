"I don't think it's fair to generalize them line that, but no matter who you are or what you do it's always a good idea to cover your ass. That's why I have surveillance cameras in my home that record on seven day cycles (all offline, obviously) There was once a guy who was accused of rape so he just showed the court his surveillance tapes. And since he had signs around his property that made it clear that there were cameras, it was deemed completely legal recording and the case was dropped like a hot potato.","# ::snt I don't think it's fair to generalize them line that, but no matter who you are or what you do it's always a good idea to cover your ass.
