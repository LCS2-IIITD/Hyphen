"Reminder that Overwatch (with Ashe) now has white women, a female robot, blue lady, women of color / a non-white race (asian, arab, etc.) At some point they need to realize that you already have a lot of representation in Overwatch and bashing them for not having that one kind of representation you desire is only going to damage your own reputation. This also happened with Hammond and boi, thats a hamster in a mech suit. Just,, are you kidding me.","# ::snt Reminder that Overwatch (with Ashe) now has white women, a female robot, blue lady, women of color / a non-white race (asian, arab, etc.) At some point they need to realize that you already have a lot of representation in Overwatch and bashing them for not having that one kind of representation you desire is only going to damage your own reputation.
