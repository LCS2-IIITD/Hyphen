"His/her waist looks to be roughly the same size as the girls. His/her legs also look bigger to me but idk it's not a great photo. Maybe they did win it fair are square, but it's a controversial win for sure. And I feel as though there should be stricter enforcement on transgenders in sports. I read about an MMA fight once where a transgender woman broke a woman's skull and gave her a concussion immediately at the start of the fight in the first round. The possibility that transgender woman have an advantage in sports is very real. Regardless to what transgenders think, its unfair to everyone else. I'm still on the fence about the thought of barring them from sports due to having an unfair advantage.","# ::snt His/her waist looks to be roughly the same size as the girls.
