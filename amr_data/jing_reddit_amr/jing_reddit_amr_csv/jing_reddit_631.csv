Why do you treat woman as walking pussies ? They have much more to offer... It feels really good to fall asleep in your wife's arms or when she cheers you up after a bad day. If you give women no respect how do you even expect to get laid/in a relationship. Also maybe stop trying to get thots to like you ?,"# ::snt Why do you treat woman as walking pussies ?

"Funny, as an american (i assume you are an american redneck at this point), you have more chances to get murdered than a french person. You guys have a school shooting every months Also, there were indeed women that fucked germans, not because they had cool cloths but rather because it would provide them food and security. (we had food tickets during occupation, and it didn't give you much to eat) About French peopel surrendering, i could argue that we won more wars than americans (don't believe me, look it up). We also lost way more men that america on both WW1 and WW2. At this point i think i have a pretty good insight of what kind a man you are. Uneducated redneck that probaly doesn't know shit about anything not related to your own country, probably with a pick up truc and a confederate flag on the back. I pity you and your kind","# ::snt Funny, as an american (i assume you are an american redneck at this point), you have more chances to get murdered than a french person. You guys have a school shooting every months Also, there were indeed women that fucked germans, not because they had cool cloths but rather because it would provide them food and security. (we had food tickets during occupation, and it didn't give you much to eat) About French peopel surrendering, i could argue that we won more wars than americans (don't believe me, look it up).
