"It's quite unfortunate that the humanities and social sciences suffered the most from postmodernist colonization. These are disciplines that help us understand ourselves, our communities and societies and our histories. They are fundamental to any functioning adult who has an interest or takes part in working/voting society. I got my sociology degree in from a well-ranked school. Almost all of my classes were very technically oriented towards statistics, survey methodology, use of polling, geospatial information systems. The focus was on preparing students to be able to apply theory, test it, and explain it while giving them some real world skills that could get them jobs. Even then, I could see the postmodernist creep in the form of classes devoted to Derridas or feminist theory injected into Anthropology course material. I cant even imagine how bad it is now. I hope that we can rid ourselves of this and get the humanities back on track.","# ::snt It's quite unfortunate that the humanities and social sciences suffered the most from postmodernist colonization.
