"It was, but it's a pretty old observation anyway, that whenever soemthing gets omitted you'll just substitute the offensive word mentally. It goes back at least to when things would get bleeped out on tv, as viewers would just substitute not only an offensive word, but probably the most offensive/crude of possibilities. It's the whole basis of the bit Unecessary Censorship on Kimmel (again, not that he's the first to make the joke) where things become profane just by bleeping out inoffensive words.","# ::snt It was, but it's a pretty old observation anyway, that whenever soemthing gets omitted you'll just substitute the offensive word mentally.
