Did he say this kind of stuff to her often? Did she tell him before this to leave her alone? If so then ya this is harassment. And just because you don't know something is considered sexual harassment or you don't know what sexual harassment is doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't be punished for it. The closest analogy I could come up with is Pill Cosby. He didnt think what he did was a crime either. You guys can go a head and down vote me now just like I know you will.,"# ::snt Did he say this kind of stuff to her often? Did she tell him before this to leave her alone?
