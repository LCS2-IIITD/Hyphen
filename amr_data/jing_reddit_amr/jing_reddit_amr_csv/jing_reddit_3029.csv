Putting that all aside, deeply confused by what you mean exactly by ""suckered""? My main point here is that we all should send more emails to the relevant parties, and I have previous information that you used to be reluctant to send emails (Pat Bidol) and were surprised that researchers or journos would respond to randos (Morten Bay). To agree with Bokhari that you should send more emails, while embarrassing given the fact that you did, is nothing wrong. The other main takeaway from my various posts on this topic is that I'm a drama-hungry degenerate and that I know it. I was completely unironically on the edge of my seat for the moment that you faced Bokhari, after his passive-aggressive callout that mysteriously left your name out. There's literally no reason he couldn't have simply tagged you in himself, except to ramp up the drama that extra notch. The shitposting that you read as ""getting suckered"" are primarily me snitching on Bokhari, with username pings, twitter mentions, and finally a YouTube comment. Sorry, but it's not in my nature to leave a boring ""hey, someone's talking shit"" and must instead ramp it up successively until I use excessive and vulgar imagery to convey that same simple message.

Your worst enemy, your friends, your family... and even yourself. A delicious and destructive revelry, where everyone is wrong. I'm quite proud of it from a literary standpoint. Really captures how much of a piece of shit I know I am, gives the reader a visceral ""yikes"" reaction, and yet seductively invites them to join me and watch the shitshow about to unfold. My final point is this: You did get the insight labs point wrong, and it's inconvenient to me that I now have to be more careful about what I say about this shit, because other topics have been more interesting to look into than Googleshit that's already covered by plenty of other people. Nobody's gonna read AoIC or UCIESC papers to me, so I was counting on you to be basically the entire basis of my opinions on googleshit. Now I've gotta do my own due diligence, and it's gonna be a complete waste of time, because I'm still going to come up with ""[Furthermore, the Breitbart discussion of what this document is and does is simply incorrect. This is a relatively objective observer describing what has happened and why, and doesn't reach a discussion of what Google should have done or should do next until much later]()"" which I basically just straight repeated out of your mouth. In other words, any amount of hostility you detect from me beyond simple shitposting is a combination of ""now I've gotta do more work..."" and ""you were the chosen one!
