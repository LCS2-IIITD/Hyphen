I won't be returning to this thread either way. PS: I don't agree with resisting arrest or with being rude to police officers. I think that if you treat them with respect and follow their instructions everyone will have a much better time. I also don't believe in a woman getting special treatment just for being a woman. I'm not even saying what happened in the video is wrong. I am saying that it's childish as fuck to sit here and high five each other over a shitty thing (for everyone involved) that happened. *Especially* that very special person bragging that he'd have dropped a knee in to her spine. Are you fucking kidding me, you psychopath? I'm all for retaliation when someone thinks they're untouchable, but you're not going to ""drop a knee"" in to the spine of a child who kicked you and can't really do any real damage to you. Or an elderly person. If someone's *that* much smaller than you, you have to take it in to account before you bust out your right fucking hook.
