"Okay, this is going to sound sexist, and I do apologize, but you've forced this hand: First off, if a man slaps a woman, he's immediately labeled as the assaulter. Which in many cases is true, however, there are also men that are assaulted by women. But when a woman assaults a man, in any shape or form, it's okay? No. It's not. It's assault. It's assault from EITHER SIDE no matter what you want to say about it. Why should one side, at least in the case of assault, be considered 'safe', when the 'safe' one is the one that started said assault by causing physical harm to the other? So please, just stop.","# ::snt Okay, this is going to sound sexist, and I do apologize, but you've forced this hand: First off, if a man slaps a woman, he's immediately labeled as the assaulter.
