">The Peculiar History of the Negro-Ape Metaphor Dehumanizing representations of African peoples are nearly as old as Europeans first contact with West Africa (Ovington, ). Early European maritime writings described primitive people who seemed more closely related to apes than to White explorers (Dapper, ). As theories of race moved from theological to biological, the rationale for racial hierarchy relied even moreheavily on the Negro-ape metaphor, as Lott (1999) described it. Although this linkage predates scientific racism, it drew increased interest and popularity when Franz Boas, the preeminent anthro- pologist of his time, and even Charles Darwin, speculated that there might be an evolutionary spectrum among primates (Lott, ) containing monkeys and apes at the least evolved end, continuing through savage and/or deformed anthropoids, and cul- minating with Whites at the other end (as most evolved; Jahoda, ).
