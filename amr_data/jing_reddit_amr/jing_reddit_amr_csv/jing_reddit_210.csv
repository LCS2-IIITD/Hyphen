"How is judging someone based on grammar in any way ""white supremacist?"" Jesus fucking Christ, do these people just think other people run around gibbering like subhuman monsters or something? Even excluding the fact that plenty of Asian, black and Native American people speak English, either as a first or second language, there are plenty of other languages out there with writing systems, rules governing grammar and syntax, even rich literary traditions. Has she never heard of Persian? Bangla? Sanskrit? Tamil? kiSwahili? Nahuatl? Javanese?","# ::snt How is judging someone based on grammar in any way ""white supremacist?""
