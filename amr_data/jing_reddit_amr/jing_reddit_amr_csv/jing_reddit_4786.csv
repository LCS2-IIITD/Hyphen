I agree but it has to end otherwise we are through as a nation. Will it be popular? NO! will there be blood in the streets? There already is so fuck it lets get this thing going no time like the present. I know trump has the goods on soros and the rest of them so mass arrests and imprisonment until a military tribunal is convened. We can use their own patriot act against them at this point. Sucks but it probably has to happen.,"# ::snt I agree but it has to end otherwise we are through as a nation. Will it be popular? NO! will there be blood in the streets?
