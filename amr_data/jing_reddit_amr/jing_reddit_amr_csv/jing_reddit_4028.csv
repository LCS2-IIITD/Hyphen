"Keeping some of that tradition still makes sense to me. The ""children first"" definitely still makes sense to keep. If I end up on a sinking cruise liner one day and I'm in line for the life boats and I see a mother and her children I will definitely let them go ahead of me. Maybe it should be ""Families first"".

"So Wendy Welfare and her hoard are a higher priority than a single adult who may be working on a completely sustainable fuel source? Yeah, that *totally* makes sense... In my mind people are individuals, who should all be assessed by the content of their character. Being too dumb to pull out doesn't automatically give a person more value. Obviously I'm not saying the scenario I depicted would always be the case. Only that it isn't reasonable to assume the *in*verse is the default. As much easier as autopilot can be, it's often best to just put in the mental work and assess individual situations as they arise.","# ::snt So Wendy Welfare and her hoard are a higher priority than a single adult who may be working on a completely sustainable fuel source?

"The comment was about families. Not just children. Assuming your reading comprehension is on par with the rest of your freshman class, I imagine you just chose to ignore that point. Families include parents. As I very clearly stated, my comment was not meant to suggest most scenarios are like the one I depicted. Only to point out that the inverse is no more inherently true. It was also just an example for fucks sake, and hardly worth getting your panties all in a bunch over. If it helps you though, you can replace Wendy with""Wally Welfare"". The gender of the parent isn't even a little bit relevant here. I simply chose what seems to be more common, as it's generally harder for a soon-to-be mother to bail and leave the fella to bear and raise the child on his own. Imagine being so insecure and hateful, that you have to twist every honest thing a person says, in petty attempts to project your social justice agenda into everything. Imagine being so far up your own ass that information and perspective have no place. That you immediately vilify anyone who doesn't regurgitate the mantra of your preferred echo chamber. Then imagine being so shortsighted you can't even see that's why no adults take you seriously.","# ::snt The comment was about families. Not just children.
