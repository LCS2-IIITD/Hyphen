"Wisecrack is corrupt, back when Netflix made Bright they showed their true colors. They tried to argue that Bright was a bad movie, while it was a refreshing new take on SciFi and Fantasy. Star Wars OT still has it's fans, and won't lose them. The new crap, the Disney shit will falter because it does not have the same fandom, the soy becomes to distracted with other empty and meaningless things. Trying to enshrine the Star Wars Brand on the level of a religion is intellectually bankrupt if you ask me. No matter what they are saying.","# ::snt Wisecrack is corrupt, back when Netflix made Bright they showed their true colors.
