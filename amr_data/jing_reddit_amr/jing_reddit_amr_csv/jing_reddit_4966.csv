"> Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of. Moderation doesn't require that content be removed. Slashdot for example, despite having moderation, never removed any comments.

Your emails are private communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which even the police are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Usenet is perhaps a better example because it is a public forum that employs a similar model of moderation to email. The ISP Usenet servers oftentimes filtered spam and the binary groups, but the posts themselves weren't removed from the system; so you could usually pay for access to servers that didn't filter. And while some groups were moderated, others weren't; and the moderated groups maintained their own rules. If you preferred to read the unmoderated groups, a client-side killfile provided crude means for user-controlled filtering. Usenet's technical considerations aside, I think modern platforms would get less push-back if they adopted/improved upon that approach to moderation: the platform just serves you the messages, lets you post, and provides tools for users and groups to moderate as they see fit without global posting guidelines.

True, but I might be able to run up to a friend and do that without being hit. Are tech platforms able to make that sort of distinction? So far they haven't done so, either because they don't want to, because it's a hard problem for the AI systems they're using, or because the content being flagged is being reviewed by someone who doesn't understand the context well enough to make the distinction. > They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.
