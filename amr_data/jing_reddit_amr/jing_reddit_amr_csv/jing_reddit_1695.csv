"I hear what you're saying. I like fantasy vidya, books and art. Cannot stand it in live action form. They always seem to do weird faux ye olde Englishe garbage and I can't take that seriously. Even if they turn around and do it for animation and I think it's perfectly awesome People flipping around and throwing their super hero powers at each other never looks right. Possibly because it's a bit closer to reality and thus harder to suspend disbelief. Maybe that's why Star Wars films never do crazy Force shit like pick up eighteen lightsabers and fuck everyone up or pull somebody inside out Animation you can get away with that. Plus you never have to worry about anyone getting hurt, or actors getting too old for the role. I imagine a well made animated film is cheaper than paying for the CGI and actors too. And on top of that, well made animation never gets outdated. The Secret of NIMH is older than me and it looks amazing still, whereas if I were to go back and look at the first X-Men film it'd probably look hokey as shit > *Deadpool exception that proves rule What about Logan? I liked how they finally allowed the character to let loose and just face/neck stab everybody, as you'd expect from real life. Some mutant powers seem hardly more dangerous than guns","# ::snt I hear what you're saying. I like fantasy vidya, books and art. Cannot stand it in live action form.
