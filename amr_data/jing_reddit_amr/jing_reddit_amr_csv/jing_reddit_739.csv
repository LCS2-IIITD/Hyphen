"Let's bring it back to the gaming aspect for a moment. (Disclaimer, the following response is not to the guy I am responding to, but to the mindset of the writer in a specific situation.) ""I enjoy videogames, but I'm not good at it and I don't want to be"" Alright then. Here's a simple advice: Do. Not. Play. Multiplayer. At all. Play Singleplayer games that are narrative driven and have a good time. Proudly select the lowest difficulty. Cheat like there is no tomorrow. Make it fun for you, because singleplayer is ALL about you. Multiplayer isn't. If you do not want to shoot for greatness, if you do not want to become better at it, do not play multiplayer. Especially not with that attitude. If you ""do not want to be good"" at it, you are Dead Weight for your team. You make things worse for way more people than just little ol' yourself. You WILL get shit. Same as a guy who, for example, during a group project would do fuck all, then lose the data he was asked to get and claim that the whole thing was his idea in the first place when it comes to presenting it, you will get a nice variation of ""fuck you, fuck your face, fuck your attitude and get fucked by the horse you rode in on you fuck"". Do not expect a pat on the head, a cookie and a participation trophy for ruining the fun of other people. You do NOT matter more than them and not giving the best you got and not actively trying to get better is an insult to your team. If you want to matter, and not have to get good, singleplayer is there for you. There are loads of guides on the net (google-fu is your friend), there are trainers, cheats, instructions, videos, maps, step by step solutions, you can always find a solution. But even in singleplayer games, depending on the game, the answer will sometimes be ""Get Better"". That game then might not be for you. And there is loads of games of any skill floor and ceiling out there, all you have to do is pick one.","# ::snt Let's bring it back to the gaming aspect for a moment.
