"Well, I was trying to keep it spoiler-free, so that those that have watched this latest season would be able to comment.

Carmilla has a weird streak of feminist bullshit rethoric, undermining every single main character in the show, while also saying that background stand-in female characters are all pissed and angry at the menz (I suppose it could just be a way of fleshing her out based on the original only preying on women, but it's still hard to tell); and she somehow manages to overtake the position of blatant future antagonist (which is surprisingly the less eyebrow-raising aspect).

"Or: INCONSISTENCY IN THE WRITING! That was my issue, particularly with Godbrand's character. He's supposed to be a barbarian type, a viking vampire brute, yet he talks about real concerns that he has over real issues related to vampire society, all the while constantly acting like a retard. All those issues he brings up, could have been given to any other of the cardboard cut-out vampire generals to bring up, actually flesh them out a bit instead of just being stand-ins, and leave Godbrand to be the brash douchebag that still accidentally ruins part of Carmilla's plans. Let's go even a step further: why the fuck was Dracula so adamant in genocide, yet did nothing but mope around like fucking Gabriel in LoS? Yes, the character does not REALLY want to sully his hands due to the conflicting feelings he has, but he didn't really have to do the work himself, and the show goes out of its way to demonstrate that he WOULDN'T do it himself. So why is the almighty lord of darkness, the king of fucking vampires, not cracking the whip on the Vamp Spice Girls and telling them ""Do this, do that, no questions""? Something that, in turn, would make Carmilla's scheming actually mean something, because she would have to find a way around Dracula's unbreaking resolve, and twist his plans to fit her agenda. And if you want an aswer: you can say the exact same thing about Darling in the FranXX, that ""it was the point"", but the inconsistencies and faux depth don't make that show any less shit, and definitely do not help in regards to Castlevania, even if it's still a good show, IMO.","# ::snt Or: INCONSISTENCY IN THE WRITING!
