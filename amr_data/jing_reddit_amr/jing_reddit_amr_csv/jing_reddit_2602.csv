Women were never different. Don't know why there is this missconception. Society tended to keep them in check better. But there were an awful lot of bad marriages and dead bedrooms in the s too. Divorce rape was just not a thing back then as well as the welfare system did cater less to women than today.,"# ::snt Women were never different. Don't know why there is this missconception.
