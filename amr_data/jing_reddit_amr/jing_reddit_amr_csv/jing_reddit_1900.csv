"Does she really look like someone who is going to have any money to be taken for? We are talking about a person who started to hump the air in front of a child after a bag grazed her flabby ass. I see her getting a pass on everything, much like the rest of these middle aged white women accusing young black men of crimes they didn't commit. Or any woman trying to file false charges against any man period. Courts need to stop showing these kinds of people so much leniency.","# ::snt Does she really look like someone who is going to have any money to be taken for?
