">So by your logic... Actually that's not my logic, but good job for the attempt. My logic is that when a word is defined by it's lawlessness it is inaccurate to use it when the event was lawful. Let's go through your examples: >unarmed black man was murdered because by definition, the state has a monopoly on force? Actually, it would be that the killing was unlawful in the first place for whatever reasons that are relevant to this event (e.g. complying with understandable police direction, being a bystander, etc.) If it was a lawful killing then they are wrong. >An anti war activist cannot say that civilians were murdered because civilian casualties are not blanket prohibited by the international laws regarding warfare? Considering killing civilians is [protected by international laws regarding warfare]() this is a moot point. >Can we say OJ Simpson murdered his wife You can considering the reason why legal cases are resolved through the judgement ""Not guilty"" instead of ""innocent"". >acquittal and double jeopardy laws suddenly render his slayings legal? No. Primarily because the case could still be tried federally, and thus would not satisfy a logically consistent definition of legal that requires the possibility of an acquittal verdict being the necessary action to render an event legal that was previously illegal for going to trial. Though ultimately you're wrong because of your inclusion of ""cannot"" without any qualifiers. I never said or suggested anything of the sort. I said you're wrong to use the wrong word and should instead use a different one. After all, each of these events are indeed killings.
