"The demands are worth reading: > They are also making formal demands to Googles management. They are: > . An end to forced arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination for all current and future employees; > . A commitment to end pay and opportunity inequality; > . A publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report; > . A clear, uniform, globally inclusive process for reporting sexual misconduct safely and anonymously; > . The elevation of the chief diversity officer to answer directly to the CEO, and make recommendations directly to the board of directors; > . The appointment of an employee representative to the board. Not scary at all. sounds like the usual wage gap misconception (inequality isn't bad if it's due to merit), depends heavily on the definitions (and the sampling, lots of abuse potential here), could turn into a gossip mill/anonymous accusations/lynch mobs, and +6 sound like a straightforward power grab.","# ::snt The demands are worth reading: > They are also making formal demands to Googles management.
