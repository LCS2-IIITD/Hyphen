"I don't see how per capita is pertinent in THIS case. It's more akin to seeing where the war is going to start. If you throw this much ""diversity"" into such a tight canister you inevitably get an explosion. In this case we're looking at a much higher likelihood of the next civil war starting there. I think this has been common sense for most of us, but this puts a pen to it and gives some perspective. During the time I lived in California it was the most deplorable several years of my life and its easy to see why - I and my family were victims of hate over and over and over and over again.","# ::snt I don't see how per capita is pertinent in THIS case.
