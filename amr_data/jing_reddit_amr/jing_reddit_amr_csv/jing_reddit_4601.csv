"The only reason Keira Knightley is even a thing is how certain standards for female attractiveness and gender roles exist. She somehow doesn't worry about the fact that she is part of the system when it's giving her money, fame and social power. But her daughters should none of that. It's like when people like Kat Von D (the tattoo reality star and makeup producer) says she will raise her kid in this vegan hippy-dippy bullshit lifestyle from birth, after having lived a life full of drugs, alcohol, all kinds of food and excess of every kind. Or when Leonardo DiCaprio wants you to eat your plain tofu in your unlit apartment because muh nature, but he can take the party private jet with his buddies and young model of the week. Maybe, just maybe normal people usually have normal relationships with those things. Don't go from media prostitute to a feminist puritan? I think it's just a typical stupid celeb type behaviour; being a walking STD museum, full of crazy, doing god knows what drugs by the cartful, having horrible people around, throwing money everywhere. Then instead of learning actual moderation, just becoming the opposite,in an equally unhealthy way.","# ::snt The only reason Keira Knightley is even a thing is how certain standards for female attractiveness and gender roles exist.
