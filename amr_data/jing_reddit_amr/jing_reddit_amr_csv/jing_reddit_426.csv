Did you not see the fucking latest patch for Windows that DELETED USER FILES. If you want to fight against sjws, fuck Sony and Microsoft as well as the Treehouse division of Nintendo. Steam and to a lesser degree, Nintendo Switch are the platforms of choice for sticking it to sjws.","# ::snt Microsoft is fully compromised by sjws.

"EA/DICE are trying that angle with BFV and it doesn't seem to be going so great. Besides, the core demographic for Gears has historically been college males of the dudebro type. I don't know of a single game franchise that abandoned its core demographic and managed to sell more catering to a demographic who doesn't typically buy third-person shooters (young adult females). They tried toning down the series with Gears of War , making it more of a family-adventure than an action-thriller and even that didn't go well for them, since it took them a year to sell what Gears of War made in a week. But if they think they can attract a bunch of female gamers by turning Gears into a story about female empowerment, all the more power to them.
