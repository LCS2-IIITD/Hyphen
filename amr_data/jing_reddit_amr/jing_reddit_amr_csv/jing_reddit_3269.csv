"It's assault and battery yes but at the same time he knew what he was doing.... seems to me like he's using the dance as an excuse to air-hump this chick, notice how as soon as she turns her head he tries to act extra casual? Not done with innocent intent at all. And from her view she just turned around and caught a dude air humping her, I'd be pissed off too. Bring on the downvotes but this dude is not exactly innocent here","# ::snt It's assault and battery yes but at the same time he knew what he was doing.... seems to me like he's using the dance as an excuse to air-hump this chick, notice how as soon as she turns her head he tries to act extra casual?
