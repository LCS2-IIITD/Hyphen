I don't think it was about defending the girl It looks to me like white shirt and Police-costume were already fighting when Thor tried to break them up. The girl shows up and takes Thor's attention allowing Cop-costume to resume his attack on white shirt. They were already fighting and the girl caused a distraction that allowed the fight to resume. Thor was the white Knight when he pushed white shirt away from the girl and allowed police-uniform to throw hands.,"# ::snt I don't think it was about defending the girl It looks to me like white shirt and Police-costume were already fighting when Thor tried to break them up.
