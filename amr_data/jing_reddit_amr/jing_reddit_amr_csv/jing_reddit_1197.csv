"> Not that I want to come across as a cop-apologist but I can certainly see things from the cops' POV. Performing law enforcement must be on of the most difficult jobs out there. Cops routinely have to put up with every leftist retard getting in their faces trying to stop them doing there jobs. If that happens enough times then sooner or later the cops are gonna make an example out of a thoroughly deserving individual. The silly bitch in question turned out to be the deserving individual. > > Even then she got off lightly. If I - a man - had deliberately and wilfully impeded cops in the performance of their lawful duties, I would expect to be either capsicum sprayed until I went blind or tasered until my balls exploded. It's called making smart decisions and accepting responsibility for those decisions.
