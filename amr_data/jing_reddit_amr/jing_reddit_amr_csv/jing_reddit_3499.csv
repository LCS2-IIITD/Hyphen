"On a Twitter thread about the Proud Boys skirmish with Antifa, started by NYC mayor DeBlasio, a bunch of people were like ""arrest these Nazis"". One guy posted a pic. There's an Asian dude, a Hispanic or mid-Eastern looking dude, right in front. It really didn't help their narrative. The people in the thread were hot & bothered, I think, because they hadn't seen the unedited version of the scuffle, only the one deceptively edited to make the Antifa dudes look like victims.","# ::snt On a Twitter thread about the Proud Boys skirmish with Antifa, started by NYC mayor DeBlasio, a bunch of people were like ""arrest these Nazis"".
