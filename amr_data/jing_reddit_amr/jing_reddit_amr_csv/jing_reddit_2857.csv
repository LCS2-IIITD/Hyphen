Shame. Shes a nice looking woman. Too bad her insides dont match her outsides. I could never imagine my wife acting like this. I think if she would have just been calm they probably would have taken her drink and let her off with a warning. She had her husband Matt and her daughter with her and she was obviously on vacation from Philadelphia and opted to act out in a classless and illegal manner. Then to call the cops white while she herself is white is amazing. I wonder if she considered herself a POC at that moment.,"# ::snt Shame. Shes a nice looking woman.
