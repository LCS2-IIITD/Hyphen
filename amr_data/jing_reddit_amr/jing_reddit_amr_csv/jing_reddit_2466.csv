"> misogynoir You are BBC, one of the most well known mainstream media outlets in the history of the world, a place which not too long ago was held as the peak of journalism and reporting, the gold standard of journalistic integrity. And today you are writing articles on buzzwords invented by deranged lunatics on tumblr. Forget about gaming journalism. This is the quality of the top of the food chain mainstream journalism. This is what the public service broadcaster funded by the citizens of the th largest economy in the world has to offer - tumblrisms and levels of journalism which makes Huffpo, Buzzfeed and Gawker to look like Pulitzer prize winning media. The very fact that this vomit inducing garbage is allowed to be published is beyond disgusting. Let that sink in.","# ::snt > misogynoir You are BBC, one of the most well known mainstream media outlets in the history of the world, a place which not too long ago was held as the peak of journalism and reporting, the gold standard of journalistic integrity.
