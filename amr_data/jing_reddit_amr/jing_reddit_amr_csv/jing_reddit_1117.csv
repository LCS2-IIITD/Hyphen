"You both realize an ""antisocial behavior"" charge is basically a ""disturbing the peace"" charge right? It's not like if you just keep to yourself and don't like talking to people they're going to charge you. It's the charge used when you're doing things like harassing your neighbors, noise ordinance violations etc. It's just an umbrella term that allows for a single charge/fine then let's the court levy the punishment accordingly instead of splitting them all up into different charges. It's basically the exact same thing as fineing someone on welfare for disturbing the peace.","# ::snt You both realize an ""antisocial behavior"" charge is basically a ""disturbing the peace"" charge right?
