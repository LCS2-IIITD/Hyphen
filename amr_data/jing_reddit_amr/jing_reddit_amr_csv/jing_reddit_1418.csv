"It's a similar story on twitter. Some members regularly search for anyone criticising Digra and harass them. Usually there is two of them and one plays the troll to antagonise the critic while the other engages in sophistry. When the critic doesn't shut up (a woman who was a frequent critic in particular) they send constant abuse and doxx them. Unless most critics of GG the people at Digra are internet savvy, and will stoop low to defend the organisation. They know they can't defend the quality of the research on its own merits, because most of it is garbage.","# ::snt It's a similar story on twitter.
