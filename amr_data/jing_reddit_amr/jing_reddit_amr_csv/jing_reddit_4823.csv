"I'll copy/paste my [comment](): Yeah, that guy's annoying. From what I've seen, the article on it was accurate. In fact, I read more or less most of the report myself. Now, what's discussed in this video is this article: Which I've previously ignored (because I've read the source). At the time the story came out, they put out -5 articles (I don't get it either, so don't ask me), and this article has had all of... comments. The article I've read, however, has - up to now - comments: And it's accurate. As for what the person in video objects to, it's these parts of the article: > Page of the document acknowledges that a few Silicon Valley tech giants now control the majority of our conversations, but that these platforms including Google must now break their initial promise to users of free speech and content neutrality. And this: > Google, argues the briefing, must move towards the European tradition and create well-ordered spaces for safety and civility rather than unmediated marketplaces of ideas. Personally, I'd first contact the person that wrote it. But, that's just me. Since the same person wrote several other articles as well. In the other article - the one which I read - it notes it accurately: > The briefing argues that Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are caught between two incompatible positions, the unmediated marketplace of ideas vs. well-ordered spaces for safety and civility. > The first approach is described as a product of the American tradition which prioritizes free speech for democracy, not civility. The second is described as a product of the European tradition, which favors dignity over liberty and civility over freedom. The briefing claims that all tech platforms are now moving toward the European tradition. ""Claims x is the case,"" obviously isn't the same as ""argues x should happen."" And: > The briefing associates Googles new role as the guarantor of civility with the categories of editor and publisher. The only line I'm not sure would be this: > For example, the briefing argues that tech companies will have to censor their platforms if they want to expand globally. It does mention it once or twice, but I'm not sure I'd say ""argues."" For example: > US-based IT monopolies are already tempted to compromise themselves in order to gain entrance to these vast and fast growing markets. The dictatorial leaders in these countries may be only too happy to collaborate with them since they want to improve their methods of control over their own populations and expand their power and influence in the United States and the rest of the world. Another thing he objects to is ""Google admits."" I can see how it might be misleading, however I'd say it depends on whether or not the ""Insights Lab"" is from outside Google, which as another user notes it doesn't seem to be the case. If it is, then yeah, it's misleading. If not - and it might not be, because as the other user says there's the link that goes back to Google, and they do say it's ""internal research,"" then it's not necessarily misleading. Here's what Breitbart said on it in a recent article: > Perhaps they buy Googles explanation that the presentation was just research and doesnt reflect official Google positions a confusing explanation, as the research is about official Google positions. Is Google disagreeing with its own researchers assessment of where the company is headed? I'd have still suggested contacting the author of the article first, but eh.
