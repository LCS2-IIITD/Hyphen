That could potentially be amazing and something really fresh, assuming it isnt some masculinized chick who kicks ass. Make her smart and mentally and emotionally strong instead of some physical brute that overpowers professional soldiers at will (something Ive though was dumb about ac games to date as well). Being vulnerable isnt being weak. Its overcoming limitations and vulnerability that makes characters strong.","# ::snt I dont want to play as a sexless character. It makes the games boring.
