"They've all been brought up on the notion that Mr. Darcy is just around the corner. I was talking to a neighborhood girl at a block party on the th. Good looking woman (about a without trying), single kid, unmarried, -23 (I think), no education, no job, lives with her parents. She was bemoaning the fact that there were no good men around. I asked what she was looking for and the list was what you would expect - tall, handsome, good job, own their own home, nice car, ... yadda yadda. She mentioned Tom Ellis from the TV show Lucifer as an example. I asked what she brought to the table to deserve such a paragon, and that completely blew her mind. She had no idea what I meant and couldn't wrap her mind around the idea that she needed to have something to offer. Kept coming back to me and asking what I meant over the course of the afternoon. I haven't talked with her since, although I've chatted with her mother a few times. Her mother tells me that whatever I said freaked her daughter out, and she'd been talking about it with her friends ever since. I note that Mr. Darcy still hasn't shown up.","# ::snt They've all been brought up on the notion that Mr. Darcy is just around the corner.
