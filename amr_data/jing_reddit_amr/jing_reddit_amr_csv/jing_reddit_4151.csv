"What bothers me about this whole thing. .

">This woman made an genuine mistake, and yeah it's horrible for the guy that he got choked out, but honestly, it was pretty badass of a '1 woman to take out a big man like that. I can honestly say in his position, so long as I got an apology from her once she realized, I wouldn't want her to suffer any consequences. If you're really butthurt about it, ask for compensation, but not criminal charges for an honest mistake. I want the law to be used against malicious people, not people who were just trying to defend themselves and enact consequences on a sex assaulter. Not like she tried to choke him to death or do any real damage, which is more restrained than I'd want to be. You think it was badass? For a man who did nothing wrong, was in a position where he felt he could not defend himself, to the point he just let her choke him out to unconsciousness? Go fuck yourself. If it's not a big deal go ahead and let someone choke you out to unconsciousness. Again he is supposed to not be a pussy about it and man up, because it was just a little ole woman. Again no one cares about what happened to him, and women's bad behavior should go unpunished. You ever see in the news where people hit their heads on the floor, street, ground, etc and die? I go back to this *""she is going away from this that regardless someone grabbed her ass, she was justified choking someone into unconsciousness even though he wasn't the person who did it, and find it empowering on top of it.* ***It's truly disgusting****""* Also let me ask, Since she obviously didn't have her female friend's consent to smack her ass, shouldn't she be charged with sexual assault? Seems to me that smack on the ass really upset her. Oh but now it's not the same because a woman did it.","# ::snt >This woman made an genuine mistake, and yeah it's horrible for the guy that he got choked out, but honestly, it was pretty badass of a '1 woman to take out a big man like that.
