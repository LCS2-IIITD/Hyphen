She only informed the Democrat leaders of this fact, which is why they tried so hard to stop Kavanaugh. RBG herself hoped that after this election, the Democrats would control the senate, which is why she planned for January. However, it looks like President Trump is going to get to name another conservative to the SC.","# ::snt According to an anonymous SC clerk, her malignant melanoma has returned, and she is resigning in January.
