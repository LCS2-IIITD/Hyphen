"He has a weekly podcast that he has been doing for years and talks politics all the time. He's liberal but he doesn't have ideological blinders on and he's willing to think critically about the positions of ideological extremists, such as the feminists and race-baiters who like to get on TV and scream about absolutely inane bullshit. He's one of the liberals who wants to keep the Overton window where it is. Problem is there are thousands of people who want to keep pushing the Overton window by saying absolutely extreme shit that they don't actually agree with in order to push the Overton window further left to get it to where they actually want it.
