"I don't exactly have time to create a full answer during the day. A little patience would help you a lot. It's not me who looks like an idiot in this discussion. I responded to the insult because there is absolutely no ""actual point"", it's just a jab at the ""leftist retard"" PM. Let's go over the facts, shall we? The supreme court [ruled in ]() that Canada failed in its constitutional obligations to Khadr on several counts, most notably that Canadian officials breached Khadr's rights by interrogating him knowing that he had been tortured (their term is ""oppressive circumstances"") and that the Canadian government had failed to uphold Khadr's constitutional rights when it ignored Khadr's request for repatriation. This all occurred under Harper's time as PM; the payout was the result of a settlement coming from Khadr's $20M suit against Canada for wrongful imprisonment and failing to protecting him as a Canadian citizen. Now we can argue all day what you or I would have done as PM, but with the SCOC ruling that Canada had in fact failed its citizen and the $20M pending lawsuit, Canada decided to settle. Would you be as angry if Canada had decided to let the suit proceed and risk a $20M payout on top of legal fees and court costs? Remember that it was your boy Harper who created this mess, and the full impact wasn't seen until after he'd been booted out of office. We can also argue all day whether you would consider the SCOC's decision was a demand to pay Khadr $10.5M or not, but it seems prudent that if the SCOC has already ruled that you fucked up and the man you fucked has a $20M suit against you, you might want to try to cut a deal, no? So in terms of absolute ""who made who do what"" no, the court did not force the payout, but they sure strongly encouraged Canada to settle, would you not agree? Trudeau said something that I think is particularly important in this discussion, and something that /r/metacanada tends to forget a great deal of the time. ""The Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects all Canadians, every one of us, even when it is uncomfortable."" The SCOC ruled that Canada failed Khadr. I'll leave you with an interesting thought exercise: If Harper had won in it's entirely plausible that the same outcome would have resulted. Would you be just as outraged if it was your boy who made the financially sound decision to settle?","# ::snt I don't exactly have time to create a full answer during the day.

"""Oppressive Circumstances"" -- Is that what you would call someone who has engaged in terrorist activities; namely killing a U.S. solider and then requests damages for being interrogated to find further terrorist ties? The fact that Canada agreed to settle for an individual that has terrorist ties, engaged in terrorist activities, killed a U.S. solider (I'm sure their family and friends would be ecstatic that the murderer of their dad, husband, son, friends etc are being rewarded with a $10m gift). And, of course we got leftists willing to defend the rights of an individual known to engage in terrorism to deaths door; but censorship of right wing views -- that's normal. What this sub and so many others talk shit about is not the fact that he was in a lawsuit and could have potentially got paid more; we argue why an individual known to engage in terrorism is somehow getting justification for this and getting paid on top? You wouldnt be fighting for this mans right if it was your father, your brother, or your husband (I dont know your sexuality or sex for that matter) being killed. Perhaps you wouldnt seek vengeance, but you would be livid if you saw a government paying an individual engaged in terrorist activities. If were going to pay this guy m because hes reformed and he had psychological issues (which is why he took up arms). Why dont we start importing all the terrorists and start arguing that they just had some sort of mental issue and we can fix it. All we need to do is get them a great doc and a lot of money preferably $10m or higher and theyll reform. Trust me, these folks are golden. Theyll be the most peaceful, welcoming, and produce citizens weve seen yet. His sister, known to defend /11 attacks and known to aid al Qaeda (and I didnt bother researching the rest of the family) is reason enough for investigation. If your family is linked to a major terrorism group, youre going to get investigated to ensure that youre not engaged in activities such as these yourself (which he was), youre not supporting this behavior through funding, and verify if you have any information linked to terrorism or the terrorism group. Harper is not my ""boy"" so I don't really give a shit what ""my boy Harper"" would have done. Regardless, Trudeau is a fucking moron. A spineless retard that thinks with the heart out and is more concerned about virtual signaling than justice. The widow of the solider - Christopher Speer - filed an injunction application to block any payout to Khadr which was filed in the Ontario Superior Court but this womens feelings and her dead husband doesnt matter here now does it.","# ::snt ""Oppressive Circumstances"" -- Is that what you would call someone who has engaged in terrorist activities; namely killing a U.S. solider and then requests damages for being interrogated to find further terrorist ties?

"So, I take the time to answer your question as thoroughly as I can and you respond by going off on a tangent about how the SCOC didn't do their job correctly? The SCOC case was about whether Khadr's rights were violated. I am no lawyer but I don't think the scope of their job included trying to figure out how Khadr ended up fighting for the enemy as a yo. Despite what your (and my) knee-jerk response is, he was a minor at this time. I believe that the SCOC ruling is fair. The debate about whether Khadr was radicalized by his family or not is an entirely separate subject. The debate over whether he should have been considered a child soldier or not is another entirely separate subject. His family ties and history is irrelevant to the SCOC ruling and to the eventual settlement. You can't choose to ignore a person's constitutional rights based on family history or upbringing. Whether you like it or not, Khadr was a minor when all of this happened. I don't know if you have children, but I do, and having raised a few teenagers and am in the process of raising a few more I can fully understand how a child can look and mostly act like a fully-functioning adult yet not have the mind nor ability to fully think as one. This is a fact that a lot of people forget about teenagers. Especially if Khadr's family is as you describe, Khadr may have not had much of a chance to do the right thing due to his upbringing. I know I sure as hell would never have sent my to a war zone to act as a translator. That's probably the biggest WTF in all of this. In a way I rather like that the US immediately tried to find a way to gain access to Khadr's settlement in order to help not only Speer's family, but also Morris, who was wounded. I think it's rather telling how there was no suit mentioned until there was blood in the water, so to speak. Seeking justice would have been filing suit against Khadr and his parents whether there was $10.5M on the table or not; Much like Canada's settlement with Khadr, there was no suit filed until it made financial sense. ""Justice"" isn't this nuanced. I retract my statements about Harper being your guy; Most people here think that Harper was flawless and that Bernier is some kind of political messiah. As I said in my original post in this thread, there are a lot of things to slag Trudeau over, but this $10.5M settlement is not one of them. Khadr's payout and everything leading up to it are a result of Harper's decisions.","# ::snt So, I take the time to answer your question as thoroughly as I can and you respond by going off on a tangent about how the SCOC didn't do their job correctly? The SCOC case was about whether Khadr's rights were violated. I am no lawyer but I don't think the scope of their job included trying to figure out how Khadr ended up fighting for the enemy as a yo. Despite what your (and my) knee-jerk response is, he was a minor at this time. I believe that the SCOC ruling is fair. The debate about whether Khadr was radicalized by his family or not is an entirely separate subject. The debate over whether he should have been considered a child soldier or not is another entirely separate subject. His family ties and history is irrelevant to the SCOC ruling and to the eventual settlement. You can't choose to ignore a person's constitutional rights based on family history or upbringing. Whether you like it or not, Khadr was a minor when all of this happened. I don't know if you have children, but I do, and having raised a few teenagers and am in the process of raising a few more I can fully understand how a child can look and mostly act like a fully-functioning adult yet not have the mind nor ability to fully think as one. This is a fact that a lot of people forget about teenagers. Especially if Khadr's family is as you describe, Khadr may have not had much of a chance to do the right thing due to his upbringing. I know I sure as hell would never have sent my to a war zone to act as a translator. That's probably the biggest WTF in all of this. In a way I rather like that the US immediately tried to find a way to gain access to Khadr's settlement in order to help not only Speer's family, but also Morris, who was wounded. I think it's rather telling how there was no suit mentioned until there was blood in the water, so to speak.
