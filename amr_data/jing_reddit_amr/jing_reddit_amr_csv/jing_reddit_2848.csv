"Heinlein experimented with many ideas about government, family structure, sex and technology. The idea that he wrote an entertaining sci fi book as a prescription for an ideal political system like he was Ayn Rand is hard for me to take seriously. We're talking about Heinlein where one of his main characters goes back in time and has sex with his own mother (Time Enough for Love.) Starship Troopers is supposed to stimulate your mind not advertise a political order. Imagine how confused you'll be when you find out he had male-centric harems in Stranger in a Strange Land but had multi-generational marriages with multiple male and female members in other books like The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Which was his ideal? Probably neither. Not every work of fiction is a politically charged message and that is just fine with me. EDIT: Also, if I were going to make an argument about what Heinlein's actual political philosophy was, I would argue it was simply TANSTAAFL.","# ::snt Heinlein experimented with many ideas about government, family structure, sex and technology.
