"Poland. Completely redpilled populace due to having been actually oppressed (oppression is not someone disagreeing with you) and caught between Stalin and Hitler. They never gave up though and good luck telling them about ""white privilege"". They might tell you about the Winged Hussars though and that they helped the West survive, so that one day mentally ill people could attack(due to the color of their skin) the descendants of people that actually fought and died for freedom and kept them and their children from being slaves. Polish CDPR. Gives in to the SJW's and fake outrage that no gamers cared about, when we don't trust game journalism anyways. What a disgrace to Poland. You don't give into Communists and Nazi's, but you give into mentally ill, wannabe Communist games journalism...","# ::snt Poland.
