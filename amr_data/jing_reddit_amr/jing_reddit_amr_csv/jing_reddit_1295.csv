"I *mostly* agree with you, and I've been involved in a Title IX incident. To make it short: I was actually the ""victim"" of harassment that was reported by someone (henceforth identified as the complainant). My ""harasser"" came to me to help me write a letter to the tribunal that identified why he was of good character. My university never talked *to me* about *being the victim of harassment*. I was never summoned to the hearing. The entire tribunal was based off of *hearsay*. As such, you are absolutely correct that *some* universities use it to just cover their ass. However, this is not what the college feminists are supposed to be doing. The job of the college feminists is to use this system to destroy and railroad defendants, then funnel the accusers into the feminist racket to pursue further criminal charges against the defendant, using the tribunal's decision as evidence against him, in addition to all of the free resources and legal assistance she will be getting, in addition to the institutional discrimination already within a lot of sex crime training. A lot of universities responded aggressively to the dear colleague letter at the behest of feminists as well as a way to protect their funding. However, it's primary purpose is political. It's secondary purpose is to place feminist activists in key positions where they can also *threaten* the college's funding if they don't get their way by immediately complaining to the feds that the University wasn't abiding by Title IX. Simultaneously, the feminist activists became ""keystone"" employees that could have *incredible* power over the rest of the school by threatening funding, removing students who were accused, or ignoring students who's complaints they didn't find valid. The system is built not at the interests of the school, but the interests of politics *in order to force the school to comply*. Make the school dependent on the political activists for covering their ass, and the ideologues become essential. It's actually a very old Bolshevik move.","# ::snt I *mostly* agree with you, and I've been involved in a Title IX incident.
