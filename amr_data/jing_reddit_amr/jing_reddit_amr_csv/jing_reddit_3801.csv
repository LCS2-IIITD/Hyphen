[Just shy of % of researchers admit to intentionally fabricating data and over a third admitted to other questionable practices in published work.]() As the authors of the linked study admit, ""Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.""","# ::snt It's also worth noting that the assumption of good faith is itself extremely damaging because it would imply that peer review has basically no efficacy when it comes to identifying actual fraud (that is, intentionally fabricated or misrepresented studies that are not being done to raise awareness but for personal benefit).
