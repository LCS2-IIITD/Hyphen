"""men are less likely to seek help..."" This is true. But now ask yourself ""why."" In the first place, men don't want to bother other people with their problems. And that's a sublime attribute. If you can do it yourself--fucking do it. Don't bother other people. But sometimes men run out of options. So who's there to break their fall? Women? lol...no. One woman studied the issue for ten years and reluctantly came to the conclusion that women are...""the patriarchy!"" >What Brown also discovered in the course of her research is that, contrary to her early assumptions, men's shame is not primarily inflicted by other men. Instead, it is the women in their lives who tend to be repelled when men show the chinks in their armor. >""Most women pledge allegiance to this idea that women can explore their emotions, break down, fall apartand it's healthy,"" Brown said. ""But guys are not allowed to fall apart."" Ironically, she explained, men are often pressured to open up and talk about their feelings, and they are criticized for being emotionally walled-off; but if they get too real, they are met with revulsion. She recalled the first time she realized that she had been complicit in the shaming: ""Holy Shit!"" she said. ""I am the patriarchy!"" Now that's pretty troubling. Does that mean we can't count on women at all? No it doesn't: if we're lucky we can count on our mothers, our sisters, and our female friends. Women are actually good at this sort of thing. But you know what? Don't go crying to your girlfriend, because your ""SO"" wants you to be a rock. That's women. They talk about toxic masculinity, but they don't mean it. Ironically, our male buddies are probably the best people to discuss problems with. You may be surprised just how supportive your male buddies are.","# ::snt ""men are less likely to seek help...""
