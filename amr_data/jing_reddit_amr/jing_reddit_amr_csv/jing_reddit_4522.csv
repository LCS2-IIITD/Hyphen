"She would not be suing him. In Australia, you get money, and some other benefits (free counciling and healthcare) from the government if you are a victim of violent crime. In some cases it can be a substantial amount of money depending on how bad the assult is. So she is upset that the government wont see her as a victim of violent crime. The people that work with this are working with people who are beaten, raped, and stabbed, or families of murder victims. I think it is a bit of an insult to them to have to take her seriously.","# ::snt She would not be suing him.

"Interesting system, what are your thoughts on it. Does it work? Or is it, how I imagine it, rife with bogus claims? Im from Canada which has pretty much the same old system like the US, and things can take a decade to go through the courts until a verdict is finally met. Are things done quicker down in OZ? Id love to see your country one day, but the huge spiders and insane heat will keep me away for the time being. I was in South Korea in August for weeks and just about died from the heat so I imagine OZ would be even worse. Cheers mate.","# ::snt Interesting system, what are your thoughts on it. Does it work?
