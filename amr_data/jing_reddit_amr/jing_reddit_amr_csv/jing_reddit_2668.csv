"The courts usually decide against the ""father"" in these cases, since they say it is in the interest of the child to have child support paid. Even if the person paying it is not the father. Because the interests of the guy paying for child support are inconsequential. Might as well pick a random dude in the crowd to shoulder the costs of child support, but I suppose the time is not right for these changes.","# ::snt The courts usually decide against the ""father"" in these cases, since they say it is in the interest of the child to have child support paid.
