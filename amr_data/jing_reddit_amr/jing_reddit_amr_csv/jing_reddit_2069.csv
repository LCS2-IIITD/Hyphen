"Sadly/Fortunately not ones that are too spicy. Airmen fresh out of Basic are a little starved of freedom and a little wonky in the head. Tech school gives more personal freedom while still maintaining a strict military training environment. Sometimes it comes out in weird ways, stuff like hearing about airmen doing pushups *while they sleep*. Personally? I got pulled to do night shift for dorm guard one weekend (basically sit at the front desk, play game boy and make sure nobody steals the dormitory full of airmen) ... only there had been a spate of trainee suicides, which had stuck a burr in the base commander's ass. Result: Suicide Prevention Breifing on Sunday, and everybody had to attend [*in full Dress Blues*]() Because of the Dorm guard duty, I was running something like thirty hours without sleep when I walked into that hot stuffy theater wearing that stuffy dress jacket with all the other airman to watch that stupid video. By the time it was over I was sleeping standing with my eyes open, and my buddies had to steer me back to our dorm by hand so I didn't fall over. There's also the Keesler shuffle.

Some Airman would go at the slowest run possible, and if you walked you got in trouble, but *many* aimen* would do this half walk/half jog that made this scraping noise on the concrete that could be heard all over the place, especially if a lot of airmen were doing it.
