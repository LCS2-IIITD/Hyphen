"I'm not immediately assuming the worst, I'm reading their statement and noticing that their logic is quite flawed, such as claiming that women are overwhelmingly responsible for growing food (while backyard gardens are a thing, the overwhelming majority of food comes from actual farms), and claiming that a word has an etymology rooted in English despite the word not being English in the slightest. They also assume that people cannot pray before eating and then complement the chef, or vice versa, an act which undermines their argument to a great degree. Their logic is extremely flawed, and they themselves identify as a radical feminist and are claiming it is connected to their idea of a patriarchy. They also say they are an atheist, which combined with their radical views could indicate that they may want to discredit a religion by claiming something as simple as saying grace is a tool of the patriarchy(while not all atheists would care about something like this, her self-proclaimed status as a radical and her arguments seem to indicate that she is one of the more aggressive types of atheist). As such, they appear to have an ulterior motive, wanting the act of saying grace to have reasons that conform to their political and theological views Based on the flawed logic and their apparent political goals, it is not unfair to assume that they are not thinking logically about the act of praying before meals, but have simply decided that it must have something to do with the patriarchy, and then tried to come up with an argument to prove their point, resulting in an argument that is nonsensical. Basically, prayer is a square peg, the patriarchy is a round hole. They assumed that the square peg would fit in the hole without even looking at what shape the hole was, and then tried to force the square peg through even after they realised it wouldn't fit.","# ::snt I'm not immediately assuming the worst, I'm reading their statement and noticing that their logic is quite flawed, such as claiming that women are overwhelmingly responsible for growing food (while backyard gardens are a thing, the overwhelming majority of food comes from actual farms), and claiming that a word has an etymology rooted in English despite the word not being English in the slightest.
