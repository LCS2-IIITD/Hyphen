"Mid-00s were kind of alright still, but yeah. This is so true it hurts. Maybe if games allowed people to create their own servers for a game like what used to be the norm that could be rekindled at least some what. The people that get hurt by words could stick to their own servers, the ones that don't can have theirs. Failing that, just let everyone be able to block whoever. Maybe make it so that you can't hear them and they can't hear you. Or maybe they already do that. I stopped doing a lot of multiplayer FPS's and shit years ago. Mainly due to my (lack of) net connection, but also due to game devs gradually taking control from players. I *really* miss dedicated servers.","# ::snt Mid-00s were kind of alright still, but yeah.
