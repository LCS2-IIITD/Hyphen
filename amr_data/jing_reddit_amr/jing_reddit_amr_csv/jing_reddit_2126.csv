Nah it is a different type of griefing. In LoL people will be toxic to teammates or play badly on purpose and 'feed' the other team kills by dying intentionally.

"Not as big as you might think, but there indeed are people that literally lose games in a row without any punishment. Its the fact that there isnt any real system to keep them in check.
