"In her defense, there was no reason for her to be slammed to the ground face-first. Just like there would be no reason to slam a dude face-first into the ground in the same circumstances. [Here]() is a video from a different perspective showing the head-first body slam. Warning- there's a LOT of whining. I recommend going to :30 to see the slam. Yeah, she had hit the cop and obstructing him. So yeah, she should be arrested. No pass on obstructing and resisting just because you've got a vagina and you managed to not be overweight. Yeah, she was making it hard to put the cuffs on. But cops should be trained to determine how much force it will take to get an objective accomplished, and to then not exceed that. Just because you've got the strength to slam a person's head to the sidewalk does not mean that it is the right thing to deploy when there's not any real danger in the situation (unless she starts clawing at the face). This could happen to your grandpa after he had four too many beers and wouldn't leave at closing time. It's not about gender or pussypasses. It is about having law enforcement that isn't trying to escalate just so they get a chance to relive their high school football or wrestling glory. I've had to fight my (more drunken than I, but not by a lot) brother on a sidewalk in Amsterdam once (note- New Years in Amsterdam is a lot of fun and I highly recommend against it). There are plenty of safe ways to put a person on the ground that don't involve risking damaging their head. American football works by the principle that when you hit an opposing player so hard that he doesn't want to be hit again, he doesn't play as well for a while. We do not need to use this mentality in our policing. We can use it in the courts. But not on the streets. It DOES take more skill on the part of the cops to subdue someone without hurting them. Similarly, it takes more skill to body-slam someone than to just shoot then in the chest times. We don't tolerate cops shooting people who are not an immediate threat. We require them to use something that admittedly exposes them to more risk and requires more skill on their part. Why should other extreme escalations of force (without regard for the subject's safety) be okay? This could be your grandpa.","# ::snt In her defense, there was no reason for her to be slammed to the ground face-first.
