"I am not ""equating"" anything. I am responding to a question that was asked earlier in this comment chain: People were discussing whether the problem with SJWs is that their ideas are fundamentally, conceptually bad, or if the problem is that they take good ideas and push them to such extremes they BECOME bad. I contend that the problem is mostly the latter and offered the idea of safe spaces as an example. In principle it's a reasonable idea that we advocate too, even if we don't use the same terminology. We want our spaces, we want the places we've built to adhere to our values, we want escapism from our real life problems, we want someplace where we don't have to deal with feeling attacked as gamers. These are fundamentally reasonable things to want. The problem with SJWs is that they take the idea to an unreasonable extreme. EVERYPLACE they go has to be a safe space, including places like universities that exist to train our minds and confront us with difficult, sometimes uncomfortable ideas. And everyplace they go has to be a safe space for them and ONLY THEM, even if it means coming into other people's safe spaces, demanding it become THEIR safe space, and trying to take over and kick out the existing occupants. That's the problem, not the existence of safe spaces in and of itself. You are absolutely right about the separation principle, we are content to be safe in our safe space, to leave other people alone in theirs, and to suck it up and deal with the rest of the world NOT being a safe space. They aren't, and that's the problem. But you are kneejerk attacking an argument I am not making.","# ::snt I am not ""equating"" anything.
