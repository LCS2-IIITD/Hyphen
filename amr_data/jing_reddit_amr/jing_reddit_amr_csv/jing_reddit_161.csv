"> even with the video as proof, I don't think police would take it anywhere near as seriously as they would if the sexes had been reversed. Thats male privilege in action! We have become the joke, the punchline. We *are* the disposable sex, after all. Why should anyone care about us, other than the whole men build civilization thing? Openly celebrated misandry has become the *in thing* of the new millennium; its now *cool* to hate on men just because they were born male.","# ::snt > even with the video as proof, I don't think police would take it anywhere near as seriously as they would if the sexes had been reversed.
