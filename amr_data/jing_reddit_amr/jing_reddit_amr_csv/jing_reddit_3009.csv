"Oh Metokur is a dick and deserves his criticisms but so far most that try to take him on end up getting bitch slapped. I pointed out he burned Andywarski and he has burned many others but then again, he has no ""internet friends."" As for what I'm doing, I'm highlighting an issue that could easily be Candid that is being spearheaded by other people and has some big name internet personalities either tricked or involved in spreading it via affiliate link bullshit. I also wanted to highlight Boogie coming out of his shell a little and redeeming himself on this issue with BetterHelp. You can accuse me of trying to promote Metokur but really he hasn't played a big role in this, it is Memology and Josh really are the one's we should be looking at with Boogie and Andywarski being the former unwitting pawns now looking at this issue with much more scrutiny.","# ::snt Oh Metokur is a dick and deserves his criticisms but so far most that try to take him on end up getting bitch slapped.
