">> Its not her condo building. At all. She just lives there, same as him. This is so dumb I don't know how to respond. Obv she doesn't own the building. I mean, wtf? She lives at the building and due to crimes there, was told to not admit people that don't live there. This is for safety reasons of the residents. The door only opens with a fob. She had hers, he did not, and did not bother to try to prove he lived there. That's on him, not her. This is called piggybacking in the physical security realm and it is not unreasonable to mitigate this issue. Don't want to get locked out? Don't forget your fob. Pretty cut and dry. Being made into a race issue bc...2018. The mental gymnastics needed to make this an issue are laughable. Prove me wrong. LOL.","# ::snt >> Its not her condo building. At all.
