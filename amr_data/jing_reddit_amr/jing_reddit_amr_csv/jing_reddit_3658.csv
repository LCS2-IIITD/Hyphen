Okay I don't really care for some of vox's opinions but what are you doing Indiegogo? All you are doing by shutting him up and cutting off his methods of making profit all you're doing is proving him and his followers *right*. Conspiracy theorists believe the world is out to get them and the one thing you can do to make sure that they don't get traction is this . DONT MAKE THEM MARTYRS. All you had to do was let them publish their stupid comic book. let it go unnoticed at the bottom of the top and then let the people forget it ever happened. Have you never heard of the *Streisand Effect*?,"# ::snt Okay I don't really care for some of vox's opinions but what are you doing Indiegogo?
