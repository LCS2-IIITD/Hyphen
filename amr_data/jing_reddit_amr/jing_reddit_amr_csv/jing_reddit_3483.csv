"What pisses me off is that she, he or whatever your preferred method of reference is, didn't deserve the award at all. You could have given the award to someone who actually did something magnificent, but no. You have someone who came out as transgender and literally rear-ended another car, pushing them into oncoming traffic which resulted in a death of a woman THE SAME FUCKIN YEAR. That is everything they have done. Woman of the year! Meanwhile there's guaranteed to be some lass that has dedicated her entire life to promoting women's rights or making insane discoveries in the pursuit of a cure for cancer and promoting females in STEM research, or many other inspirational stories. But nah, you have Caitlyn Jenner. Enjoy. Go fuck yourselves.","# ::snt What pisses me off is that she, he or whatever your preferred method of reference is, didn't deserve the award at all.
