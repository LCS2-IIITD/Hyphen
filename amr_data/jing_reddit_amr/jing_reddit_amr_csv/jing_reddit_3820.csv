"You cannot say she was defending her property as he walked away immediately after kicking their vehicle. Any action taken, after that point, is a completely separate incident and would need to be justified independently of the vehicle kick. It's like if someone punched you, then began walking away. You aren't defending yourself if you just to attack their back as the threat has already ceased and is actively creating distance, thereby progressively diminishing any possibility of a future threat rapidly.","# ::snt You cannot say she was defending her property as he walked away immediately after kicking their vehicle.
