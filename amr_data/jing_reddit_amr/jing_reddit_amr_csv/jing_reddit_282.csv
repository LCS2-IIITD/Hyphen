"I think getting hit is not an excuse but a good reason to hit back any gender. Real feminism isnt obnoxious, you are. Equality isnt loud, you are.

I wont take my own time to educate you, I dont even believe its possible. Close minded, egocentric people care much more about their own appearence and reputation than the conversation itself. If you think gender equality is bringing ""down"" women, It might be coming from you believing women are weaker and/or cant handle their own choices. Its ignorant, and it undermines your white-knight persona in the eye of real feminists. In your case you sound like a wife-beater who tries to compensate with weirdly-formulated generic opinion you dont really understand the meaning. Saying women are systematically the victim while defending feminism is hypocrite. Feminists dont want to be victims, thats the very point of equality. They want freedom of choice and the same treatment. Positive or negative, it comes hand in hand. A woman want to work hard and be successful, she can do so. A woman, an adult even, has made the poor choice to drink too much and hit a police officer, therefore made a choice to suffer the consequences in this modern society. Everything is rationial here, the whole context and suite of events feels logical, except for you. Throwing meaningless insults to strangers wont change that. Doesnt make you feel better about yourself, and for sure doesnt make you appear more informed. The term ""moraly challenged"" isnt just for nazis or mean people.
