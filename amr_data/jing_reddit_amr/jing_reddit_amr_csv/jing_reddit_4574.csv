Good luck brother. I hope you get answers and the opportunity to reconnect with you father long term. My aunt did the same to my uncle and three cousins. They divorced she took kids and bad mouthed my uncle and they hated him. When they were & he sat them down and told them his side. She was cheating on him as he found condoms in her purse but hed had gotten snipped. I saw them crying and hugging and then they placed the blame where it belonged. All these years later I see post from cousins with my uncle and never their mother. Women think that the truth they hide from their children will never come out.,"# ::snt Good luck brother.
