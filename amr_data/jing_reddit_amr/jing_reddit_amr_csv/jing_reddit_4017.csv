"He needs to read some of the subreddits all of us here frequent. It's dangerous enough for a guy just to date some girl who isn't already vetted by your friends, (crazy, false rape, looking for a baby, etc), much less forming a **legal contract** (marriage) that gives them control over your fucking life. If they get in an accident on their honeymoon and he ends up the hospital, she can pull the plug on his ass, LEGALLY. Take everything and keep on trucking because he's a stranger.","# ::snt He needs to read some of the subreddits all of us here frequent.
