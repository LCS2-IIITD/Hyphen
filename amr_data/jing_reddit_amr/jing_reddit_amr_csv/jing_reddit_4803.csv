"[edit] shit, I misread your title. Anyway here is my quick translation of a thread on Sony US censoring JP software from one of larger chan aggregation sites: . Excuse any typo, shitty formatting etc. First ish comments: I'll be honest, this direction is no good Nothin' but restriction of free expression Dunno what it [home version?] is for, so whatever PS5 They've done it There'll be no demand for PS5+ The only ones complaining are creepy weebs, so is it really a problem?

""We won't apply any voluntarily regulation like foreign versions. (darkening, angle alteration, etc.)"" If so, then I'd be fine with it for now, But that's not the case, is it? It's high time you realized what you do is shameful Of course they will reject your stuff VitaPS If this will silence the assholes that complain Vita displays are too harmful or they can't take their kids to the PS software corners, so be it () GameCube Killer of the Dark Age [? ] was much more loose (there were girl nudes, however crude) I guess this is just what happens when theer is no competition I don't think this is a good thing, but you can only blame the ever-noisier feminist retards Those assholes say with a straight face stuff like ""Girl characters are too attractive; make them ugly"" cs I think they should do it on PC About the same price as a CS platform anyway I can only see the future where it's only used for Western games [e.g. FPS] I see They are trying to make femis attack the Switch In English, what is this?
