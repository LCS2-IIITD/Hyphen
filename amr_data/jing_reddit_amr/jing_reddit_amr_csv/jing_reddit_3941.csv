I'm gay and don't feel the need to disclose my sexuality to everyone I'm meeting.

People tell me that I don't usually ""ping"" on their gaydar so I've gone quite a while with people not knowing and then one day I mention my boyfriend or something and they go, ""Wait, you're gay? How come you never said anything?!"" And it's kind of like, ""I mean, you didn't waltz up to me and say, 'Hey, I'm straight, I just wanted you to know that I'm attracted to the opposite sex.'"" Why should I have to? Also, a lot of times I don't come out to people right away is that disclosing your sexuality before someone gets to know you creates this sort of image in their mind. I've had friends tell people they're introducing me to that I'm gay before I even meet them and they assume I want to take them shopping or decorate their house or something (when I seriously couldn't be less interested). I like my personality dictating how people view me, not me liking hot guys.","# ::snt > or them not being close enough with you personally to discuss their sexuality or many other reasons than they have some sort homophobe-sense. % this.
