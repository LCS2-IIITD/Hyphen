"Actually I preferred them to stay out of the kitchen. I swear either one of them could mess up different pans, bowls and every utensil in the house just microwaving a bag of popcorn. I'd clean the kitchen before work, work + hours and come home to both sides of the sink full of dishes, multiple empty coffee cups around the house, coffee grounds on the kitchen floor, and no toilet paper in the bathroom. (not to mention laundry strung around the place etc. They would always have some bullshit reason why she was too stressed or whatever to ever clean. The moment you get done cleaning something up, they'd breeze in and act surprised ""I was just going to do that..."" Bullshit.
