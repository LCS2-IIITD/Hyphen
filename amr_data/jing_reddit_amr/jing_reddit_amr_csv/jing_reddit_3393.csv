"The jewposters complaining about Jews sound identical to BLM complaining about white people. They're more successful than you so they must be up to something, and they're a threat that must be stopped by force because they're too powerful to compete with. It's all such fucking nonsense. Some jews are successful, deal with it, compete with them by working harder, not by freaking out all day on the internet, and inventing insane conspiracy theories that are so obviously retarded. Looking at the government, and at the people I know, the jews are far from the only ones who are pushing globalism and multiculturalism. Is Justin Trudeau a jew? No, let me guess, he's mind controlled by the secret power jews and isn't responsible for his own retardation, as a result. People can act out of the interests of their own country without a jewish conspiracy being a driving factor behind it.","# ::snt The jewposters complaining about Jews sound identical to BLM complaining about white people.

And why do you think JT embraces multiculturalism and globalism? He's a vapid conformist. A parrot who literally recites globalist slogans. There's a reason the NPC meme has been so effective at stereotyping the left. Because much of the left, Trudeau especially, are parrots and conformists. It is totally irrational for a leader to celebrate the death of his own nation state by bragging about how his country is the first post national state, but it is rational for a historically oppressed minority who may feel vulnerable to the power of nation state to take comfort in such an outcome . As I said, there's no conspiracy, just a *disproportionate influence*. Conformists, the naive, morons, good little girls, and the emotionally manipulatable can be influenced to adopt values that are not in their best interests. That is pretty much the far left in a nutshell. And for the record before you straw man me more, I actually have a high regard for Jews.
