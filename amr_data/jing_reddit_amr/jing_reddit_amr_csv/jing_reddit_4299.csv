"I have some cider but I'd rather space it after a few hours after I take my anti-depressants. I thought about getting some bourbon but as much as the taste is fine it seems to numb my mouth pretty fast. Yay autistically sensitive.. well senses. Maybe I should get some and mix it in stuff. Sweet tea maybe? Also I did that cause I'm cheap, and a buddy of mine said it was good. Though he told me when I have my opinion to it. ""I think you have an unrealistic exception of alcohol. Apple cider is not going to taste like apple juice+ additional alcohol."" It wasn't too bad though. It wasn't fucking beer. I don't much care for beer. It's the taste at the back of a swig, or a sip. I think that's the hops? It makes me think of coffee and the bitter taste at the back of it no matter how much shit you do to that coffee. Though mikes or this cider I an stand, though I could taste the lemon more in mikes than the apple in this. <shrugs> Besides I may go back to sleep and I probably shouldn't drink right before doing that. Maybe I'll be wrong, maybe my niece will have a good life- or at least the kind of meh life I have without having children she didn't want(not me more like my brother) and then emotionally abuses or shit. While some people(debatedly deservedly) on kojima's writing there is one line in MGS4 that struck profoundly with me.

This is a *fundamental* problem with the understanding of people like SJWs. Unless there is a massive current problem starring you in the face. Stop trying to ""fix"" everything. You will likely just make it worse. Stop changing things that don't need changing. You are making your existence upon this planet, your entry into the experiment that is mortal life, a net negative for everyone else- and possibly even yourself. People NEED far more discipline and humility than they tend to currently possess. I probably have too much and it turns into a kind of self loathing. These people *are* fuck ups because they never stop and reflect, and ask if they might be making a mistake. I constantly ask myself if I'm doing the wrong thing.
