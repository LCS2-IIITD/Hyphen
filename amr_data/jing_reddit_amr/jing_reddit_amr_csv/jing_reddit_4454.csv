"The claim that ""any ideology"" is correct, after all not many people would like to be friends with actual bona fide kleptomaniac narcissistic egoists with a God complex. &; But when you want total agreement even over what the minimal wage should be to the penny/cent, and you see compromise for that as evil, then you're of course become a pariah. &; Thus the personal lines in the sand. For some people it is slavery, or racism, or freedom of speech. Some people even don't mind threats to their own personal safety, as long as they get to be near powerful people. (Which happens in areas with very high rate of crime, where chances of a calm future are already slim to none.)","# ::snt The claim that ""any ideology"" is correct, after all not many people would like to be friends with actual bona fide kleptomaniac narcissistic egoists with a God complex. &; But when you want total agreement even over what the minimal wage should be to the penny/cent, and you see compromise for that as evil, then you're of course become a pariah. &; Thus the personal lines in the sand.
