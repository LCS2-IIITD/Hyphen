didn't Aydin Paladin explain the science and it turns out there isn't a demographic of soulless people but that due to the brain being so resource heavy all humans go into a mindless autopilot state from time to time to conserve energy? thus it's more like you become a bit player in other people's stories than some people having no story if i make sense.,"# ::snt didn't Aydin Paladin explain the science and it turns out there isn't a demographic of soulless people but that due to the brain being so resource heavy all humans go into a mindless autopilot state from time to time to conserve energy? thus it's more like you become a bit player in other people's stories than some people having no story if i make sense.
