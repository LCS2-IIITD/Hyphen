"actual transcription from the video: > I felt uncomfortable with the **route** that he was taking me, I had obviously been drinking that's why I was in an Uber, and the route was just a different way that I had never been taken. she didn't say she feared the driver, but the **route**. I interpreted it as she was afraid of getting out of the car in a neighbourhood she didn't know. Obviously this doesn't excuse her behavior towards the Uber driver, but I don't think we can judge if she was afraid to get out or not.","# ::snt actual transcription from the video: > I felt uncomfortable with the **route** that he was taking me, I had obviously been drinking that's why I was in an Uber, and the route was just a different way that I had never been taken. she didn't say she feared the driver, but the **route**.

The recording made it sound like she wanted him to follow the GPS and he wasnt? Not defending her but I am so awful at directions. When an uber driver asks me where to go I just have to make shit up. Yeah that sounds right,"# ::snt The recording made it sound like she wanted him to follow the GPS and he wasnt? Not defending her but I am so awful at directions.
