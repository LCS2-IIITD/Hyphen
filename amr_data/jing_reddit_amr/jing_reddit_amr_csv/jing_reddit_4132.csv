"Please don't blame all this on rap music. That's like saying that people shoot up schools because they play violent video games; it's completely unfounded and stupid. A better reason is because, simply, older people are more mature. You're the not first person to say that young adults are ruining good values. However, the common theme that the past few generations have shown is hatred towards authority, it's just manifested in different ways throughout the different cultures.","# ::snt Please don't blame all this on rap music.

"I completely agree it has to do with maturity as well, but it's silly to disregard such a popular culture having an impact on youth. And this culture is celebrated constantly. People are subjects of their environment. When a negative environment exists, it's important to try to improve that environment. Keep in mind I'm a young adult as well. I make mistakes and I'm sure I have plenty of misguided opinions, but when something so backwards is celebrated this much across all races it surely has to be a concern. I also don't believe whites as a race are seen as authority anymore. I think authority has become a much broader term now. Once I was pulled over by a black cop after I picked up my good friend from his home in Camden. He's Puerto Rican and he was also with his friend who was black, who is also a good friend of mine. I got off the exit and was immediately pulled over for ""going in a "". I can't even make this shit up. The cop ID'd both of my friends and never asked for mine, even tho I was the driver. They had to step out of the car and get patted down while I watched. Obviously this is a pretty specific and unique situation, but I do think this happens more than we want to believe and the moral of the story is authority transcends race. People in power will abuse the power regardless of race, as this cop did. And it doesn't have to be that way, I just think that's typically the way it goes down. Authority in this country needs to change, regardless of race.","# ::snt I completely agree it has to do with maturity as well, but it's silly to disregard such a popular culture having an impact on youth.
