"Hadn't seen this Candace Owens/Joe Rogan clip. ...What a fucking idiot. And a liar. Once again she's conveniently ""misremembering"" that it was ""Trump"" usernames harassing her, when it was originally reported BY HER to be people with ""Gamer"" usernames. Also, SHE IS WRONG about it being Quinn, it provably was kiwifarmers that doxxed her. Her complete ignorance is so painful to hear. Anyway, here's a link to the last time I had to call out Candace Owens for being a retarded conspiracy theorist and/or complete sellout","# ::snt Hadn't seen this Candace Owens/Joe Rogan clip. ...What a fucking idiot.
