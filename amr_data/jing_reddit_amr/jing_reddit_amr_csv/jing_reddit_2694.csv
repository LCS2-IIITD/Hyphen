"Insane but I wouldn't call it a pussy pass. I mean if she has been abused(100% chance, just read the article. That motherfucker assaulted his next girlfriend as well and went on to star in porn videos) and regretted what she had done immediately by calling and having them help salvage the situation... why should she be prosecuted? If she gets unjustly beat and wants some revenge well I guess she got it. Her having a second husband though... What kind of guy would marry and have a child with a woman like that? Does he not know? How do you marry a woman that has cut off a penis with a knife before and have a kid with her are you fucking asinine","# ::snt Insane but I wouldn't call it a pussy pass.
