Have you ever considered the possibility that rape is low because the crime itself is actually rare and it's feminist activists that have been going out of their way to scare people over into thinking otherwise? And that you have these women taking advantage of the hysteria in order to not only inflate the numbers but work it to their advantage and have something to gain from these accusations personally? You also didn't provide a source for your statistic.,"# ::snt Have you ever considered the possibility that rape is low because the crime itself is actually rare and it's feminist activists that have been going out of their way to scare people over into thinking otherwise?

"> it's remarkable to me how you don't realise what sort of stigma comes with being falsely labelled like that. We see that a lot from feminists. My hypothesis is that empathy requires a minimum level of intelligence, which many feminists fall below, thus rendering them essentially sociopaths due to sheer stupidity. More research in to the phenomenon is clearly needed, but I think my hypothesis will serve to fill the gap until it's replaced by a better one.","# ::snt > it's remarkable to me how you don't realise what sort of stigma comes with being falsely labelled like that.
