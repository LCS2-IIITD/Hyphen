"Yeah man I gotta say, a lot of people dont realize just how fragile we are. I guess since we arent exposed to physical violence like we used to be its easy to be frustrated and yell for blood when these kind of things happen. I got downvoted like hell in a post because I said I try to intervene as early as I can if people fight... you land one right blow and it can mean life or death People overlook the fact that even being the aggressor gets you hurt, knuckles and wrists get all fucked up, when adrenaline wears off you start feeling sore where you didnt even know you were hit at This was about an old guy and woman. Old woman was yelled at for not picking up her dogs poo, woman got mad and grabbed the poo and threw it at guy, guy throws a punch and was about to go on but someone stopped em before it went further People claimed i was an SJW giving pussypasses lol but had nothing to do with the gender. Gets me goin when I think of it lol stupid sheltered people who never encounter physical violence Whew..: went on a tangent there... my bad","# ::snt Yeah man I gotta say, a lot of people dont realize just how fragile we are.
