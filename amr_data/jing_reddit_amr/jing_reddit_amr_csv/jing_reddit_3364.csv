"Summary: Three academics decide to test whether disciplines such as gender studies, cultural studies, fat studies etc. only exist to push an ideological agenda. They do so by writing papers to the top peer-reviewed journals in the fields. The papers advocate for things including fat bodybuilding, chaining up school children for being privileged, studying rape culture through dog-humping incidents at dog parks and re-wording Hitler's Mein Kampf with feminist jargon. Funnily enough, they were almost all published and heralded by the top scholars in the fields. &; Wall Street Journal also did an article on it and verified it: []() &;","# ::snt Summary: Three academics decide to test whether disciplines such as gender studies, cultural studies, fat studies etc. only exist to push an ideological agenda.

This chapter is the one in which Hitler lays out in a multi-point plan which we partially reproduced why the Nazi Party is needed and what it requires of its members.

Of note, while the original language and intent of Mein Kampf has been significantly changed to make this paper publishable and about feminism, the reliance upon the politics of grievance remains clear, helping to justify our use of the term grievance studies for these fields.
