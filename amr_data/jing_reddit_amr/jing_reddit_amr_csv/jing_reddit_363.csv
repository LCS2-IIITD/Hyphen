"I'm cm. I honestly prefer tall women. You should see the reaction of some of my female friends and colleagues , who prefer tall men, when they learn that I prefer women who are at least cm or taller but as long as they aren't taller than me. They think that it is okay for women to take a preference but it is the end of the world if I, a man, have one too.","# ::snt I'm cm. I honestly prefer tall women.
