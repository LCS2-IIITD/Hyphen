They were the first generation to be completely brainwashed. By the compulsory indoctrination centers. They were the first to be NPCs. When I think to myself about them. I have a hard time staying angry. The US won WWII the vets who came home and started popping out babies. Weren't adequately vigilant against the corruption taking place in Washington DC. Most of them created the suburban bubble life. Depicted in the 's TV shows. Eisenhower the last good POTUS warned. During his farewell speech. That a corrupt military industrial complex was growing in government. The citizenry soon forgot about his dire warnings. So the US has pretty much been at war ever since. Now a host of other corrupt industrial complexes. Have been legislated since the 's. The baby boomers also had no idea. About the societal corruption we who have been born after. Have had to endure. They're now willfully blind to there massive screw ups. When I listen to them talk. They still worship the government. They still believe the bureaucrats have all the answers. To every societal ailment.,"# ::snt They were the first generation to be completely brainwashed. By the compulsory indoctrination centers. They were the first to be NPCs.
