The fact that she's a teacher makes it a problem among others. She's in a position of authority over the kids. Even though age of consent is like where I'm from it still would be illegal (teacher student relationship) and really frowned upon in society. So she still deserves punishment Although yes it's also different from actual rape or if he were younger,"# ::snt The fact that she's a teacher makes it a problem among others.

"You're right, but it's pretty clear to me that most won't see it that way. There is a big push now of male and female being seen as exactly the same (which is relevant to this sub of course). Let's be honest - young guys are horny bastards and the girls are focusing on other things like schoolwork and other activities. Except in some rare case, these events are not a poor little young Billy cowering in the corner as predator Patty is shoving her tits in his face. In the case of a male teacher and underage student though, I could see it being more forced, because males are horny fucks and girls don't want anything to do with dirty old guy dick. Most of this is common sense shit we just know, but online it's like blasphemy. Anyway, this obviously isn't an argument that will ever be settled. Where I do think we can probably end up agreeing though, is this: regardless of whether you think the women was really a predator, or if it was some idiot woman and a horny kid student, ultimately she did cross a legal line and she should face consequences. As much as we might see the story for what it really is - a pathetic women who wants attention and a young kid getting some ass - it wouldn't make sense to just let it go and say ""I understand"". Obviously you can't have teachers fucking their students, you'd have to fire them immediately regardless of the circumstances. And there should probably be legal punishment as well. So I think we need to take away our emotional attachment and hangups about these situations and treat it more objectively like a speeding ticket. Fucking one of your students? Fired and face whatever sentence is determined. I'm not going to call this stuff rape when the guy is happy to get ass from his hot teacher. But I can agree that these things can't just go on like it's no big deal either.","# ::snt You're right, but it's pretty clear to me that most won't see it that way.
