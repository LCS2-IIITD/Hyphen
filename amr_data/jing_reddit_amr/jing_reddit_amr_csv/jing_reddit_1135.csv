"Ehhhh. Not so fast, Mombot. The problem with nerds is that too many of them are like Boogie. They're desperate for attention and the approval of the very people who ostracize them to the point that they will throw the rest of the nerds under the bus just for an invitation to chauffer Chad ajd Stacy to and from the prom. That dynamic is what killed GG. Optics cucks were desperate for normies to approve of them so they held the door open for those who would set fire to the whole place. I wish it were different but oddly, relative to population, I've dealt with more treachery and betrayal from nerds than Chads and Stacies.","# ::snt Ehhhh. Not so fast, Mombot.
