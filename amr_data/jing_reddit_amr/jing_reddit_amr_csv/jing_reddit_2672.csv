"I don't think it's any better or worse than most other ""movements"", but the fact that this modern form of ""feminism"" is becoming more and more prominent and widespread definitely *is* a problem. The problem with feminism is that it comes in all shapes and sizes; there are plenty of feminists and feminist movements that are perfectly reasonable, focusing on equality rather than just propping up only women at the expense of men, just like there are absolute horror groups that are little better than the KKK in their violent agenda. This makes ""feminism"" a near-impossible term to properly debate, because while my criticism of one group or movement might be spot-on, it might miss the mark completely with another one, yet both groups will call themselves ""feminists"".","# ::snt I don't think it's any better or worse than most other ""movements"", but the fact that this modern form of ""feminism"" is becoming more and more prominent and widespread definitely *is* a problem.
