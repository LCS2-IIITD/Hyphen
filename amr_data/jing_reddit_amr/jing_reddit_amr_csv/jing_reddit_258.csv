"I agree that situations are always different when its someone close to you. If this guy was my brother, best friend or son I'd be devastated and wondering what other problems could've possibly been going on in his life to bring on such a tragedy and what I could've done to prevent it. As the outsider looking in however, I see a weak person, so weak in fact they are willing to kill themselves to be a man in this worthless excuse of a humans eyes. I also see someone that mentally unstable as being a potentially future danger to society. Call me crazy, cold, callous or out of touch, but I'm not gonna call this a loss.","# ::snt I agree that situations are always different when its someone close to you.
