"So a quick search lead me to the origins of some of these terms. ""Stan"" comes from an Eminem song so...a white guy. ""Tea"" in slang terms apparently originated among drag queens, and I wasn't able to find a specific origin for ""I'm screaming!"" but most arrows point towards Tumblr teen girls. Literally the only one that can be specifically traced to ""AAVE"" is ""weave snatched"". Honestly, they're words, get over yourself. The comic creator too (who I know works for Buzzfeed so his self-flagellation is par for the course) is particularly embarrassing. ""I'm not sure if I really have permission to make comics using those words"" FFS, stop acting like a milquetoast sycophant; words are not owned by anyone, use them to your heart's content. People who get hung up on words ""belonging"" to a certain demographic are severely lacking a personality.","# ::snt So a quick search lead me to the origins of some of these terms.
