"Remember when Jordan Peterson first rose to prominence by saying laws like this could be used to criminalize people refusing to use a trans person's pronouns? And SJWs laughed at him, they said that was impossible, didn't matter if a law could technically be read that way, nobody would ever do that, it was completely paranoid to think, the delusions of a fearmongering right wing lunatic. And yet here we are, and exactly that is happening.","# ::snt Remember when Jordan Peterson first rose to prominence by saying laws like this could be used to criminalize people refusing to use a trans person's pronouns?
