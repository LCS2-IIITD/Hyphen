"Hey, what happened to equality? I thought all of us were for it. So if a chick kicks a guy, it's equal to a random dude kicking kicking him and if he is justified in beating his ass up, he is ""equally"" justified in beating her ass up. Besides, she started the fight, he ended it. And don't start telling ""she was doing it for fun."" What do you think would have happened if the guy did that? The chick could have him kicked out of the bus and have him branded a molester/sex offender and ruined his life faster than you can say 'Feminism isn't about equality.' Having a cunt doesn't magically make you a fragile creature. Girl hits you? Knock her the fuck out. . And if no one wants beatings, better keep your hands and legs to yourself. To the guy in the video: if you're reading this, you did good. But perhaps start with hitting her legs off firmly and not go straight to smack-down mode, will ya? chances, if not complying, go all Fourth of July on her ass, or his ass if it's a guy.
