"I genuinely didn't even notice Rebirth Huntress was apparently still the 'new' version. Like, I noticed her skintone was a bit darker, but not like the [New ]() one from the **Grayson** series. I was so confused when I got round to reading **Grayson**. Is the original Huntress still around? Or is she now the Helena Wayne version? I'm clearly out of the loop.","# ::snt I genuinely didn't even notice Rebirth Huntress was apparently still the 'new' version.
