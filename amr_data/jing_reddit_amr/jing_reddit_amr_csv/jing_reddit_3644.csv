"> Usually grimdark is edgy for the sake of edgy, no substance or content just Uhhhggg life is everlasting pain sorrow of hell that springs forth from my blackened soulllll. No nuance, no understanding, no real character. That sounds like a bad attempt at being ""adult"", that crap usually goes beyond grimdark into everything just being so shit that it's really not worthwhile anymore. Usually written like something a twelve year old came up with after watching a Tarantino movie while high on cough sirup. Also tends to feature a mary sue lead (speaking entirely in one liners and pseudo-philosophical gobbledygook), which shouldn't ever be a thing in grimdark. Basically the Hellsing anime, except not fun.","# ::snt > Usually grimdark is edgy for the sake of edgy, no substance or content just Uhhhggg life is everlasting pain sorrow of hell that springs forth from my blackened soulllll.
