I guess I just didn't realize this group became a ""all women suck and we're all going to be single forever.""","# ::snt The ""/s"" is missing Edit: I thought this group was about men being independent, not willing to settle and literally carry a shitty partner, and instead help shift the balance of power by saying enough is enough while being able to reap tangible benefits by not catering their entire lives to that.
