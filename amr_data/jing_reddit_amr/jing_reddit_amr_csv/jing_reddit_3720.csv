"Can you cite some sources that back up your claim that women have significantly lower iqs than men? From my research it varies from country to country and it's usually a difference of about either way. Sometimes women have higher, sometimes men just depending on culture and location. Also, your inability to learn through academia is not because you're smart. Nothing is simple, your inability to grasp the concept of nuance is showing.","# ::snt Can you cite some sources that back up your claim that women have significantly lower iqs than men?
