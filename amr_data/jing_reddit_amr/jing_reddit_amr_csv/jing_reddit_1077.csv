"We don't know if they're lies -- on either part -- because there was nothing resembling an investigation. Ford never filed a case because the statute of limitations had past; she made an accusation, went to DC to tell her side of the story, asked for an investigation, and nothing worth calling an investigation happened. As for lies, Kavanaugh perjured himself and was still appointed.
