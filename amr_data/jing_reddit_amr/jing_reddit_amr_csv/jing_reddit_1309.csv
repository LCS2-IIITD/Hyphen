"Bullshit. She was chimping out on the guy and wouldn't stop. She started shit up with him several times even after telling him not to talk to her. She was the one who made it so that there was no way to figure this out through talking. Whatever you think about the judge, no one made her smash her racket like an angry toddler or abuse the judge. Also, I don't believe you're a fan of this sub. This isn't (or at least wasn't) a place for concern trolling or swallowing this 'men are pigs, too!' bullshit that feminists will try to spin once their own behavior gets them in trouble.","# ::snt Bullshit.
