"Did you ever think that funding, friends, family, culture, finances, local crime and many other things affect studying and results in school? In my country there is definatly a difference between natives and refugees in school for example, but if said refugee has come to the country before they have started school and their family has integrated, then the difference is negligible. Even if you claim IQ differences, you can overcome those easily with better teaching and encouragement for education. US public schools are in general a pretty shit example since the funding and quality of teaching can vary huge degrees, not to mention things like normalisation of crime and poverty in manu areas ect. This doesnt create a very even ground for such comparisons to be made equally.","# ::snt Did you ever think that funding, friends, family, culture, finances, local crime and many other things affect studying and results in school?
