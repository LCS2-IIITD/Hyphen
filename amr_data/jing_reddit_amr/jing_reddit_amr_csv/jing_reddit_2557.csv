Good. I think my biggest issue with these rape accusations is the time in between them. Like fucking years? Get the fuck out of here those type of accusations shouldn't even be looked out without definitive proof. Bottom line if you get raped report it immediately. If you do not report it then it is YOUR fault the rapest doesn't get justice. Also all accusations without definitive proof should be looked at as false untill a thorough investigation is done. The accusations that have only dna and victim testimony as proof should result in both the victim and the accuser being put in lockup while a investigation is done. The victim and suspect should be cross examined Multiple times. This entire investigation should be private period. Any breach of that should result in harsh consequences. And the penalty for false accusations should be considered a felony and carry at least /3s of a rapest sentence.,"# ::snt Good.
