"So just to be clear: About million men and teenaged boys died fighting in WW1. The majority of these men didn't have the right to vote, because suffrage in Europe was contingent on property ownership, and most working class men didn't own enough property to be enfranchised. The mountains upon mountains of straight white male corpses propelled the universal suffrage movement to the forefront. Women achieved the vote upon mountains of dead males, both in Europe and the US (see: civil war). Not a single woman had to actually fight for suffrage. She suffered no real risk. She just had to complain to the men in power. And the ""patriarchs"" in government gave women the vote with no conscription obligations (that's not equality, that's chivalry) as soon as the majority said they wanted it. These men and boys, who suffered some of the worst deaths humanly imaginable -- having their guts blown out in trenches and inhaling poison gas, being eaten alive by rats while crucified on barbed wire -- were ""privileged"", according to feminists. A sizable percentage of feminists from the time period actually encouraged men and boys -- who again couldn't vote -- to go die for them in the trenches, to protect female ""honor"" (see white feather campaign). While the suffragists demanded universal suffrage, the suffragettes wanted only rich white women and men to vote. We celebrate the latter, not the former, because the former draw into question feminist mythology [Edit: there were some women from the time period, often described as feminists or proto-feminists, who were consistent; eg the American anarchist Emma Goldman (whom I'm quite sure would be appalled by modern feminism) helped mount a legal challenge arguing that conscription was a violation of the th Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court disagreed. Ironically Goldman considered the suffragettes a bunch of spoiled brats, and famously claimed that ""if voting changed anything they'd make it illegal""] Hundreds if not thousands of men were executed on the front lines to prevent desertion, even though historians now agree that many WWI campaigns were useless suicide missions, that the men knew it, and that the ""deserters"" were in the right not to throw their lives away for a patch of mud. In the US, men were imprisoned, tortured and even executed for refusing to fight. These included conscientious objectors from religious groups. (two of these men, Hutterite brothers, were tortured to death at Alcatraz). The majority of American men who fought in WWI were effectively forced to do so. Far more Americans who fought in WWI were conscripted than volunteered. Today, little rich girls who would be living in the gutter without the benefaction of their rich daddies, and living in caves without the benefaction of men as a group, condemn powerless white men and boys from a hundred years ago who died being eaten alive by rats while crying out for their mothers -- because they were white, and male. Yes, this is a perfectly sane society, and feminism is a perfectly sane philosophy. Moreover it encourages ""gender equality."" Honestly, I don't feel hate. I just feel shame and disgust. Shame for what feminism has done to this society, and disgust for both the men and women who have allowed this to happen.","# ::snt So just to be clear: About million men and teenaged boys died fighting in WW1.

"Bro, you need to calm the fuck down. I never said I'd let a woman talk over me, especially if she's being disrespectful.

That would reflect well on the MRA group, and be better for everyone. Ironically, your comment was the most NPC thing I've read today. How cliche.","# ::snt Bro, you need to calm the fuck down.
