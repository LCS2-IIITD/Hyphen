"She ran for the NDP in my ridding in the last provincial election as well. Came by my house door knocking well I was out working on the tomato garden. Talked to her for a few min, seemed nice enough and undeterred by my large Doug Ford and local candidate sign in my yard. Didn't really get the sense that she was all that politically astute though, and more or less her campaign was focused on her being the first openly trans-woman to run to be an MPP. She came in a decently close nd, in a ridding that has been Liberal since the 's. Think if the NDP had put up a candidate that spoke french they would have been able to win here. Either way she put in some hard work, I don't think school trustees really do much, and to be honest from what I've seen of them, most of them aren't the most centered people either. We'll have to wait and see what, if anything, she does. More than likely she'll go to a few meetings, make a few speeches that will be listened to by a few douzen people and she'll cash in her $/year paycheque.","# ::snt She ran for the NDP in my ridding in the last provincial election as well.
