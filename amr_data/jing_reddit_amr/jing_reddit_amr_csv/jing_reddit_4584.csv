For sure but we mostly riff on the Asians and middle easterners cause they're always asking for discounts or sales lol. Best joke though is culo herboso which means grassy ass in Spanish.

You said I work with a bunch of illegal immigrants. And that's the problem you don't even. By the way that's something a woman would say. You can't even comprehend that you shot off at the mouth and someone called you out. By the way I seem to remember another comment that conveniently got removed which started this whole thing. I know I don't like it when people drop white privilege. It is still a privilege to live in this country and even if they are illegal they get that. I don't think you get that.,"# ::snt You said I work with a bunch of illegal immigrants. And that's the problem you don't even. By the way that's something a woman would say.

The problem with the argument that illegal immigrants are bringing violence to this country is that immigrants who arrive to this country to commit violence never stay. They get deported then find their way back to our country again and again and again. The ones who landscape our backyards, fix our roofs, serve you your McDonald's breakfast and coffee and clean up your home are not the criminals, that is not their intention. They just heard about the American dream and they want a piece of it if you want to call that a crime. The ones who really want to commit crime don't want to stay here. They come here to do what they need to do and go back to their corrupt country. I'm not defending this girl, she did commit a crime. She is hardly a career criminal though and while she got a slap on the wrist it's not like she physically hurt anybody. Material goods were stolen and returned and some sort of punishment was rendered. The financial stipend was relative to her ability to earn.
