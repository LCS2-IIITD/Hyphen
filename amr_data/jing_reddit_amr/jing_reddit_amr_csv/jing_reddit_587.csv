"Rule summary, because the auto-moderator mandates it and we do what the auto-moderator says: Star Trek discovery is in a bad place. Its in the same sort of a place as a highly touted first round draft pick of your favorite sports franchise is after the GM and the Coach who drafted him have gotten fired. Think Current Lakers' Head Coach / Dead Man Walking Luke Walton. The sign-up numbers for CBS all-access are bad. They went down significantly after STD came out (according to an extrapolation by the video in the OP). My Comic Book Store Guy is fond of saying this about digital comics. For over a decade now, everyone in comics has been told that digital is the wave of the future and that paper and ink don't have long to live. Yet, every single month, the digital outlets call my CBSG and try to convince him to hawk their products. As my CBSG is fond of saying, if you don't know what the numbers are for digital comic sales (and no one does) that means they're bad, because if they were good, you would never hear the end of it and those sales numbers would be highly publicized. If you're not hearing CBS talk at great length about exactly how strong CBS all-access growth is, that means the numbers are dismal, because if the numbers were good, they would never stop talking about it. Now, it appears the first five episodes of STD season went way over budget, because what was screened was received horribly and reshoots were ordered. Think Justice League, think Solo: A star wars story. Now, Les Moonves, who was the champion of STD at CBS, and those who are loyal to him on the board, are out. CBS can cancel STD and Moonves takes the entire blame, and the new board gets to write it off. The leadership that backed STD being gone removes the Sunk Cost Fallacy for eliminating this piece of trash. The new Picard series (which I'm not yet sure how I feel about) being fast-tracked provides a replacement possibility. The shorts were made to be sold to distributors as a way to generate some cash to cover STD's losses. Netflix has not liked the performance they got from STD season , and they are not backing season . They made the shorts, and no one wanted them, much like no one asked for STD in the first place. Everything about STD rubbed me the wrong way from the very start, I'm glad its on life support and I'm glad it will soon be cancelled.","# ::snt Rule summary, because the auto-moderator mandates it and we do what the auto-moderator says: Star Trek discovery is in a bad place.
