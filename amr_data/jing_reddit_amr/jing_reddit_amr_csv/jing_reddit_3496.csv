"I can understand being upset about bots and trolls, but political activists? Political activists are allowed to have opinions; if you don't have an opinion as a political activist, you probably aren't a good political activist. Very few political activists going to rallies holding signs with a picture of Catbug saying ""Everything is OK!"" Whether they're out their on election day reminding you to vote, or in the streets during the women's march or marching in a pride parade, it's OK to be a political activist and speak their opinion on their political cause of choice publicly. Let's not demonize political activism because you disagreed about a movie where an alien tries to use a droid as a slot machine.","# ::snt I can understand being upset about bots and trolls, but political activists?
