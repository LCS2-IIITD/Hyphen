"Yeah i watched a news video showing highlights where the dude with the flag was walking through the capitol saying he wants to meet these anti fascists, and right after showing up, he was straight up attacked. His flag was ripped off the pole and he was pepper sprayed then assaulted. Im not sayimg i support his beliefs but holy hell those antifa people were violent. Edit: turned my autocorrect off, still learning to type without it","# ::snt Yeah i watched a news video showing highlights where the dude with the flag was walking through the capitol saying he wants to meet these anti fascists, and right after showing up, he was straight up attacked.

The Nazi pressing charges is literally a Nazi. The Traditionalist Workers Party, which he is actually a member of, is a neo-Nazi organization. I dont mean that they are right wing.

"I think being a Nazi, an actual Nazi, not just right wing, is cause to be assaulted. I dont mean people that say death to all Muslims on twitter, or even racist people. I mean people who are members of Neo-Nazi organizations. If you would like to know why, its because Nazis use our love of free speech and the free marketplace of ideas to undermine those very things. Nazis do not give a fuck about freedom of speech, they just know that you do give a fuck. They actively want to remove freedom of speech and freedom of movement and freedom of association and freedom of being alive from people simply for being born not white. Its naive to think that the free marketplace of ideas can defeat these people, because they arent actually participating in the marketplace. Theyre gaming the marketplace to co-opt it and destroy it. And people are too stupid to notice it happening. Its obvious that the marketplace of ideas has failed as the violence we see at protests now is a symptom of that failure. I believe that there are ideas that can undermine the entire structure of our country and we must do everything we can to protect ourselves from these ideas. If you think America cannot be defeated by an idea, then you need to understand that America as founded on ideas and defeated Britain with those ideas. The war with radical Islamic terrorists is going to be won with an idea. Fuck man, its arguable that the idea of America and the H-bomb is what has kept the world in relative peace since WW2.
