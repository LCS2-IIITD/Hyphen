"CMV: /r/metacanada is the right wing version of /r/politics At least T_D celebrates Trump and his policies. Bernier and Scheer (for the few ones which are still with him here) are tweeting daily, giving interviews and organizing meet ups almost every other day and you see almost nothing about that here. Everything here is about Trudeau.","# ::snt CMV: /r/metacanada is the right wing version of /r/politics At least T_D celebrates Trump and his policies.
