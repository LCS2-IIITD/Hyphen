"Generally I think even dumb impeachment must be voted on in the Senate. But the ""court"" doesn't need to last very long. Basically if the chief justice who runs the ""court case"" wants to get this over with he can make the whole process happen in a single day. Though Robert's will probably treat it seriously which mean no fast trial but also no bullshit from the dems either. The evidence will be heard and the witnesses called and delaying tactics and grandstanding will be shutdown. Then after closing statements the Senate will vote and it will be over. Since the odds that /3rds of the Senate that is mostly Republican and who thinks this whole Russian thing is bullshit the chances of a convention are so low that they would need to take Trumps mask off scoobydo style to reveal literally Putin to have any chance to get those votes. Further its really only a card the dems can play once. Since afterwards they can't go after Trump anymore and they look like they just wasted a lot of time. So basically if the impeach him they will lose big in but there is also a small chance they uncover a proverbial smoking gun and remove him from office. Though chance of that is very low. So my guess is they just threaten impeachment but never actually do it. They know it's a bullshit claim that sounds even worse when put under the spotlight.","# ::snt Generally I think even dumb impeachment must be voted on in the Senate.
