"Did any of you actually see what happened? She literally only called the guy a thief for taking her point. Men have cussed out and threatened empires with no recourse. Men are allowed to walk around shirtless, but the female tennis players can't walk around in their sports bra? I'm a fan of this sub but anyone who actually watched what happens knows it was bullshit and I believe her. He absolutely would not have docked a guy a point, let alone a match for the same thing","# ::snt Did any of you actually see what happened?
