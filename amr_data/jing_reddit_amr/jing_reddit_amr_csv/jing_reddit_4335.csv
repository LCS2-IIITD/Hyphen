"Haha, I thought I was the only person who'd used a colour picker to settle the issue! For those who don't know what's going on: feminists and SJWs are calling this cartoon racist because ""Serena is drawn as black while her opponent has been turned into a blonde, white woman"". Well, fact is her opponent does indeed have (bleached) blonde hair at the moment, so that part is true. But the two of them are both coloured the same shade of brown in the cartoon. Sorry, feminists.","# ::snt Haha, I thought I was the only person who'd used a colour picker to settle the issue!
