To be fair judging a school by its SJWs is like judging it by its Greek life. You'll get a skewed and pretty negative view of it. Honestly it's mostly just in the Facebook group that I see this kind of thing and it's always the same few people posting it. Then again I'm mostly focused on doing well in my classes and spending time with the people I actually like and avoid anything political or generally SJW-y like the plague,"# ::snt To be fair judging a school by its SJWs is like judging it by its Greek life.
