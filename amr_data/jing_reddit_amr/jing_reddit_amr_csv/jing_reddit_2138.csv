"In her two posts all she has said is that his use of watching porn bothers her. Not any reason, only that it bothers her. Is his use of porn affecting their sex life, or is he watching porn and ignore her all the time, or is he watching porn and not go out with friends, or .......? Maybe if she told us the reasons I may have some sympathy, but, no, not in this case. She gives an ultimatum, it did go the way she thought it was going the way she wanted to go. Sorry, that's the problem with ultimatums, they are like going all in at poker, you win, or you lose all your money and walk from the table.","# ::snt In her two posts all she has said is that his use of watching porn bothers her.
