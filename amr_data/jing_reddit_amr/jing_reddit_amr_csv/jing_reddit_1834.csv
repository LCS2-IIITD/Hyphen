"Nope. You wanna stare at your phone wandering around in the dark with headphones on walking into traffic? That's your problem. I'm not going to lower my gaze you entitled piece of shit. Also, you're more likely to be killed by a guy jumping off a building committing suicide, than a homicide based on pure, actual numbers. So keep that gaze to the skies. Why don't you cross the road? You're the one with the god damned mental disorder and schizophrenic paranoia. I'm done assisting your delusions and confirming them so you get a free side walk. You have a phone, Uber/Lyft/Taxi you lazy sow. I'm scared, I think you'll rape me, cross the fucking road and get away from me. I'm '2"", I'll walk on all the sidewalk I want, how about once in your life, you entitled pig, you walk in the fucking grass instead of me getting gum and shit all over my shoes so your lazy, entitled, princess ass can feel ""safe"".","# ::snt Nope.
