"You're free to question the motive, it just seems the claim was specifically discussing a particular search result, rather than the fact that all [word]+Pedophile searches are blocked, which is more interesting than choosing a specific [word] which was chosen for its polarizing effect. searching for ""The Pedophile site:reddit.com"" also returns zero results, this generic common word would speak volumes as to the problem more than ""biden"" which carries political charge and infers, whether you admit it or not, a very distinct answer to any questions that you suggest we would ask. This changes things, I do not agree with the example used, I found that the answer used is not what it suggests, but it does suggest something in a broader scope, which now I do indeed question, but why is it this way, that is indeed a good question and one I'd love answered.","# ::snt You're free to question the motive, it just seems the claim was specifically discussing a particular search result, rather than the fact that all [word]+Pedophile searches are blocked, which is more interesting than choosing a specific [word] which was chosen for its polarizing effect. searching for ""The Pedophile site:reddit.com"" also returns zero results, this generic common word would speak volumes as to the problem more than ""biden"" which carries political charge and infers, whether you admit it or not, a very distinct answer to any questions that you suggest we would ask.
