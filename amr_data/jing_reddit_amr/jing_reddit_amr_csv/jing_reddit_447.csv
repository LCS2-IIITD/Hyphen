"Yeah but you can't necessarily use ""creeped out"" as the basis for things like that. As long as the person is of the age of consent and is aware of what they are consenting to I don't particularly mind. That being said, there's also a dude who had oral sex with a and a year old girl he was a karate instructor to, and he deserves to go to jail because even the y/o wasn't of the age of consent for that state and even if she was he was sticking his dick in a year old's mouth and that's absolutely repulsive as she's not really old enough to understand the consequences. As much as I'm for gender equality I'd be pissed if it was a year old dude and a year old girl, and vise versa.","# ::snt Yeah but you can't necessarily use ""creeped out"" as the basis for things like that.
