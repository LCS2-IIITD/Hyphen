"The last four books released by Dinesh D'Souza explain what he refers to as 'The Big Lie.' The lie being that the Republicans have been historically and are currently racist/fascist, that they switched sides during the Nixon administration, that racism was south vs. north problem (not a Democrat vs. Republican problem) and that Democrats are the party of tolerance and kindness. The evidence that he uses is -The voting record of each party on the amendments mentioned in the meme (I do not believe that the numbers are correct, though the ultimate point is. Democrats, in general, were opposed to granting rights to blacks.) - The racist/fascist history of the Democrat party (including voting against the amendments mentioned in the meme. Their support of the KKK (the militant arm of the democratic party). The passing of the Jim Crowe laws, and more.) - Democrat leaders fascination with fascist/socialist leaders such as Hitler and Mussolini. - Democrat president's racist backgrounds (which includes FDR, Woodrow Wilson, and Andrew Jackson). - How the Democrat party used wellfare to tear apart the family unit of the black population and set up a new, nation-wide plantation for minorities. - How cities and states run by the Democrat party tend to mirror the living conditions of slaves back in the pre-Civil war era. - How no republican ever owned any slaves. All of these examples (plus many, many more) are used to back up the point OP is trying to make. If you are genuinely interested finding evidence for these claims, I would highly encourage you to look into Dinesh D'Souza. His books and YouTube videos do an amazing job at presenting this information.","# ::snt The last four books released by Dinesh D'Souza explain what he refers to as 'The Big Lie.'
