"Why is everyone here ignoring that the writer says we shouldnt make Steve Rodgers black because it wouldnt make sense for his character. The dude clearly gives an example of a situation where he thinks a white actor couldnt be replaced in a heroic role. Geralts whiteness is not key to his character, the blackness is key to Black Panthers character. Steve Rodgers is a small white kid in Brooklyn - a black kid in Brooklyn at that time would have a totally different experience so you cant replace him unless you are telling a totally different story.","# ::snt Why is everyone here ignoring that the writer says we shouldnt make Steve Rodgers black because it wouldnt make sense for his character.

"Well his point is both - its all about the best actor for a job where race doesnt affect the in-story version of the character. Aka Heimdall in Marvel and in Norse Mythology is described as ""The Whitest of the Gods"" - but does it really matter for what he needs to do? Nah, just cast the best actor for the role in Idris Elba. Human Torch in Fan4stick? Can be white dude or black guy, doesn't matter much as long as he fits. But T'Challa or Steve Rogers? You give it to the best actor of that particular race that showed up. I think obviously you can make exceptions in all these cases - like Othello is obviously a Moorish man, so he is a black guy - but there are sometimes race Swapped Othellos, where it will be a white guy as Othello and the rest are black actors.","# ::snt Well his point is both - its all about the best actor for a job where race doesnt affect the in-story version of the character.
