"It's rape. When someone is in a position of authority over someone else, and they have sex, it's classified as sexual assault. This is why prison guards cannot have sex with prisoners; If they do, even if the prisoner was down with it, it's still rape because the guard has the authority and power to punish, reward, or control the prisoner. The same applies when it's a teacher and a student. The authority makes it rape, not just statutory rape.","# ::snt It's rape.
