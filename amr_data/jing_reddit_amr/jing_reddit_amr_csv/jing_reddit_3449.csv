"> It really is just a question of performance and voicework. Kassandras Melissanthi Mahut is stellar, while Alexios Michael Antonakos is just not on the same level, though I dont mean to pick on him personally. They always fucking do this man. Denigrate the male voice actor. It's so contrived and shitty of them. They're doing it for political reasons. Like, male shep voice actor was good, but got this all the time.","# ::snt > It really is just a question of performance and voicework.
