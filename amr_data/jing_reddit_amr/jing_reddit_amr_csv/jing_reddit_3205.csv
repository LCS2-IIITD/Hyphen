"Plain and simple, if you're going to run around complaining about (((teh jewz))) go elsewhere. He's been warned once before for that shit and it's a direct violation of rule . One offs are generally able to be ignored provided that the user in question isn't a single purpose account who thinks this is MDE2 Electric Boogaloo. But if you have to be told a few times to lay off the jewish conspiracies, you're going to get slapped. Like I said, this isn't the first time he was slapped for it. Hopefully when he comes back in days he'll knock it the fuck off. That's the goal of just not outright banning people on sight. There are plenty of places on reddit that welcome this behavior and discussion. We are not and will not be one of them. We are open to all faiths, creeds, and political opinions, and we will not discount our jewish users so that the alt right users can bitch about getting constantly cucked by an imaginary entity.","# ::snt Plain and simple, if you're going to run around complaining about (((teh jewz))) go elsewhere.
