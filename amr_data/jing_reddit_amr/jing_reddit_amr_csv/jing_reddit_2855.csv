"Getting away with it for their entire lives. Like a badly trained dog or a toddler that is never punished correctly they learn this behaviour through lack of consequences. The blame thusly lays squarely at the feet of their family unit (dysfunctional/fatherless/abusive/etc), their direct social circle (friends, co workers and people they studied with) and then only indirectly at the people they surround themselves with in their wider community and society. Because it takes a trashy low quality human to produce more trashy low quality humans you tend to get pockets of these spring up in specific ""community bubbles"" as they tend to be self rewarding - for example if your entire family is like this then they put direct pressure on everyone else they come in contact with in that neighbourhood/area to also conform to that type of behaviour which has a cumulative effect if other trashy families are also present. TLDR - this is learned behaviour.","# ::snt Getting away with it for their entire lives.

Have you noticed that you typically see more of this type of behavior from females than males? Do you think that it's because some parents are 'easier' and more indulgent on girls? Or is it bacause some people think they can bully their way into getting what they want because a vast number of people these days are afraid of confrontation? I'm the mother to a teenage boy and if he ever even thought about acting like this he would not enjoy the consequences. I agree with you % this behavior is learned at an early age.,"# ::snt Have you noticed that you typically see more of this type of behavior from females than males?
