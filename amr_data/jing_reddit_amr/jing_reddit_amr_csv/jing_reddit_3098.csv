"In all seriousness, I do think GamerGate got trump elected. GG shook a lot of peoples faith in the media, and then he ran on an anti-mainstream-media platform. Of course, the real problem is that his opponents saw him doing this and ran on a pro-mainstream-media platform. I think the media reaction to GG, portraying them as a small cabal of trolls, obscured the fact that GG was a response to a growing schism between viewers and the media in general.","# ::snt In all seriousness, I do think GamerGate got trump elected.
