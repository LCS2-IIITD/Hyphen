"Ah! But your definition of homosexuality is, to certain people, an **opinion**. Even though your definition is a loose paraphrasing of the literal definition of homosexual ... you'll find regressives who argue that it's wrong.

Like racism? Remember when it was a feeling of superiority towards another race or showing extreme prejudice based on race? Now they move the goal posts on what racism means so that only white people can be racist because muh power. Even tho we just had a black president for years. Could black people be racist then? Not according to the post-modernist definition lol.,"# ::snt Like racism? Remember when it was a feeling of superiority towards another race or showing extreme prejudice based on race?
