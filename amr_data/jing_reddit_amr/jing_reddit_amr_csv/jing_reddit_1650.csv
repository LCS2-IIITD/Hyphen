">I am of course very supportive of what Title IX and the movement are trying to do, of their efforts to confront and to prevent abuses, for which they also seek some sort of justice. But its for that very reason that **its so disappointing when this incredible energy for justice is twisted and turned against itself,** which is what many of us believe is happening in this case. In other words, justice for the victim and preventing abuse is only a concern when there's not a male victim or a woman, especially a feminist woman, committing the abuse In other words, justice for the victim and preventing abuse is not a genuine concern at all, and it's really just about demonizing men and perpetuating the myth that sexual violence is something *men* specifically are responsible for","# ::snt >I am of course very supportive of what Title IX and the movement are trying to do, of their efforts to confront and to prevent abuses, for which they also seek some sort of justice.
