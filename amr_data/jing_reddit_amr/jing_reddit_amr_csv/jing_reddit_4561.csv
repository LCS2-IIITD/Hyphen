"I think this was from the Plinkett review, but they point out how the original was an action flick with jokes while the remake is an Avenue for jokes with some action inbetween, and that completely changed the dynamic of both movies Also, the observation that Winston was just a guy looking for work while leslie Jones was a loud black woman playing a stereotype. Ernie's race was completely irrelevant to his character (he was the everyman, that's all) while leslie played it up *hard*","# ::snt I think this was from the Plinkett review, but they point out how the original was an action flick with jokes while the remake is an Avenue for jokes with some action inbetween, and that completely changed the dynamic of both movies Also, the observation that Winston was just a guy looking for work while leslie Jones was a loud black woman playing a stereotype.
