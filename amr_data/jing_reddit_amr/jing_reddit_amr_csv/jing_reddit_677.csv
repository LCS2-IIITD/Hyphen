"Not without a case that can't be turned around like an episode of Matlock. clintonemail, DNC, DCCC: There is more than exculpatory evidence in all these hacks. Marcel Lazr Lehel, Warren Flood, Seth Rich did each of them respectively, with evidence and data to back it up. The media could so easily do a write-up on any of these or maybe pick one as the one that did ""the thing."" If the media can't even report a single real detail, it damn sure isn't seeing a courtroom. I almost think Trump wants the witch hunt to continue.","# ::snt Not without a case that can't be turned around like an episode of Matlock. clintonemail, DNC, DCCC: There is more than exculpatory evidence in all these hacks.
