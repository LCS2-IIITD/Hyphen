"Why doesn't the downvote button work on your comment? I love Ellen, but her behavior really isn't appropriate nor is it fair to give her a pass when a man doing the same thing would get blacklisted by society. Comparing her behavior to the idea that pop songs are about sex is pretty ludicrous. I don't think that pop culture is healthy, but just because it exists doesn't mean that I can't also think that Ellen is in the wrong here. Pull your head out of your ass and realize that two things can be wrong at the same time, they're not mutually exclusive events. Defending one wrong by saying ""people do worse so shut up"" is despicable.","# ::snt Why doesn't the downvote button work on your comment?
