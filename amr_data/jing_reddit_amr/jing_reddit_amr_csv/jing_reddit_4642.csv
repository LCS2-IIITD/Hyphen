I do not understand why I always have to point out the main deep issue while liberals screech about superficial arguments.","# ::snt A guy whose job it is and been in countless press meetings where someone takes the mic from him to pass it on... isn't aware someone will come to try to take the mic after the President says next and moves on to the next reporter? And ""she touched him"".. wow.. the delusion is strong with you. Let's not even make it about ""touching"" then. When a woman whose job it is to pass the mic comes to you to get the mic from you, a reporter should give it with less hesitation than Acosta. That is unprofessional and a good reason for him to lose his credentials. Or are you saying that every White House reporter should be able to hold on and keep the mic and not give it to the woman whose job it is to pass the mic? Could you imagine the disorder of a press conference in that situation... which is why what he did is unprofessional and lost him is credentials. Do you notice how you guys never talked about the main underlying issue. I do not understand why I always have to point out the main deep issue while liberals screech about superficial arguments.

If he didn't know how to crop I would understand, but he knows how to crop but doesn't? Look at here where I call out the ""assault"" claim and got upvoted still because the fact of the matter is a whitehouse reporter should never hold onto the mic to keep talking when a woman comes to get the mic to pass on!! (THAT IS THE ISSUE) (This is no more assault than Kavanaugh being assault, but even then you have more proof of Acosta assault because there is an actual video evidence of him touching the woman!) If you can show me the same from your post history where you call out the antics of your liberals, I would appreciate that. Furthermore, the whitehouse didn't even say it was assault. They only said a reporter should never have to touch a woman whose job it is to pass on the mic. Other examples of him being unprofessional Are you trying to say that it is okay for reporters now in the White House to physically touch every woman to keep talking whose job it is is to pass on the mic? That is the reason why he lost his credentials. I have yet to see you say that is wrong and a valid reason he lost his credentials... (that is what it comes down to) CNN being fake
