"Vibrators don't consent but they don't also look and act exactly like a sentient being. People in this thread are making fun of the guy saying ""sex robots are a red flag"" but this is already the justification used to ban simulated/photoshopped child pornography (defined as photos of actual children made into porn, not talking about drawn or D child porn which is a murkier issue) No children are harmed in making fake child porn, but it is still banned under the arguments that a) can be used to teach real children b) creates a market and audience that might then escalate to real child porn. Conversely, some argue that fake child porn could be an outlet that prevents someone else from harming a real child because they can ""safely"" live out a harmful fantasy. In the same way, an argument could be made that someone who gets off on raping sex robots could be just practicing and then feel emboldened enough to try the real thing. Or they could be using it as a safe outlet. It's a complicated issue and both sides have valid points so I don't think either side deserves to be mocked.","# ::snt Vibrators don't consent but they don't also look and act exactly like a sentient being.
