"I dunno, I work with a networking organization for women, so there are frequently only women at the meetings. In that case, you'd generally say something like, ""Alright, ladies, let's get down to business,"" instead of ""Alright, guys, let's get down to business."" That being said, I don't think the second version sounds entirely wrong. It's just that ""guys"" is **often** used to refer to either a group of men or a mixed-gender group; I don't really see people address a group entirely of women as ""guys"" too often.","# ::snt I dunno, I work with a networking organization for women, so there are frequently only women at the meetings.

"When women refer to themselves as ""ladies"", it makes me cringe (I'm also a woman).
