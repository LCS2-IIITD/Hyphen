"In a lot of studies and international metrics, work is measured in terms of paid work and unpaid work. We all do work, things we have to do to maintain and advance our lives and society. Some of that work is paid employment, and some of that work is not compensated, such as cleaning the house, mowing the lawn, taking care of children, etc. This is considered unpaid work. Men do more paid work than women but less unpaid work, and the disparity in unpaid work is larger than that of paid work, resulting in women spending more time per week working than men, but less time in paid employment.","# ::snt In a lot of studies and international metrics, work is measured in terms of paid work and unpaid work.
