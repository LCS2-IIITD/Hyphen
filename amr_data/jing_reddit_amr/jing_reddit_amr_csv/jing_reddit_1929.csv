If viewing all women as less than you and in need of your protection helps you to feel good about yourself, it's whatever. Some of us just truly think of women as actual equals is all. Sorry if that offends you, but also not sorry. All humans are only human. Having certain genitals, or being irresponsible with them, doesn't make anyone better than anyone else. Because equality. Duh.","# ::snt Literally zero hate. I'm used to those with zero integrity intentionally misinterpreting my ability to be objective, though.
