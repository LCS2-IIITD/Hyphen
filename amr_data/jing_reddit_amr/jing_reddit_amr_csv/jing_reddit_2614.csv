"Seems like the only one projecting here is you. You've assumed I'm generalizing a type of person you identify yourself as so you're in here in self defense mode over a meme. All I did was shitpost a meme and you went out of your way to rebuke it. Which means it must apply to you to some degree. Maybe I'm referring to people who actually believe what is up in the OP instead of just ""liberals"" or ""lefties."" I'm not going to pretend to know this person's political leanings...it's a good thing the NPC meme was made to shame specific behaviors instead of political ideologies. However, it is no coincidence that certain political ideologies tend to be overrepresented among the NPC population.","# ::snt Seems like the only one projecting here is you.
