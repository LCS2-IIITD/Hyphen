Narrative has already started. Gop are suppressing votes by not counting all ballots. They are beyond parody at this point and have lost all common sense. You mean that finding ballots days after the election is not suspicious? Are these the people who keep telling us that we are not uneducated? Id much rather be a non college graduate blue collar worker with common sense than professor with a phd who lives jn a bubble.,"# ::snt Narrative has already started.
