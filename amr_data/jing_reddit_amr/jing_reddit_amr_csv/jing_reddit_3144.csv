"I follow bogleech cos I liked some of their stuff. But a lot of it's pretty 'eh' to me and their political views are pretty dumb sometimes. Like this here.

A lot of it comes down to politicans just plain not doing their job, and/or doing it incompetently.","# ::snt I follow bogleech cos I liked some of their stuff.
