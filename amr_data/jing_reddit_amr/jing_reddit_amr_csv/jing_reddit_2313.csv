"I think that if that's your experience, perhaps you're acting like a stereotypical clueless uncouth Chinese mainlander, that doesn't realize how rude he or she is being, and is pissing off their Chinese-American friends and has a bit of a inferiority-complex chip on their shoulder. I mean, everyone knows that the Chinese have the worst stereotype for manners and selfishness if going by broad generlizations. Which is the main problem, there are so many in China, especially older or poorer, that literally never learned even the most basic etiquette. They are like the polar opposite of Japanese in that respect, and you can do rude things around Chinese mainlanders and they may not respond negatively, because they too don't even understand its rude... totally oblivious. Just as a random example, had a Chinese woman just push her ass in front of me, when we're all standing in a line politely waiting our turn, didn't know anyone just literally elbows in and had to get rude back with her to get her to get in line like everyone else. Chinese-American woman would never be so rude, as they were brought up to know acceptable social behavior. Not to mention, Chinese will literally just spit right in front of you, sometimes even indoors or an elevator, its like WTF... Chinese-Americans would never do that. I'll take an average Chinese-American girl over FOB any day of the week.","# ::snt I think that if that's your experience, perhaps you're acting like a stereotypical clueless uncouth Chinese mainlander, that doesn't realize how rude he or she is being, and is pissing off their Chinese-American friends and has a bit of a inferiority-complex chip on their shoulder. I mean, everyone knows that the Chinese have the worst stereotype for manners and selfishness if going by broad generlizations. Which is the main problem, there are so many in China, especially older or poorer, that literally never learned even the most basic etiquette. They are like the polar opposite of Japanese in that respect, and you can do rude things around Chinese mainlanders and they may not respond negatively, because they too don't even understand its rude... totally oblivious. Just as a random example, had a Chinese woman just push her ass in front of me, when we're all standing in a line politely waiting our turn, didn't know anyone just literally elbows in and had to get rude back with her to get her to get in line like everyone else. Chinese-American woman would never be so rude, as they were brought up to know acceptable social behavior. Not to mention, Chinese will literally just spit right in front of you, sometimes even indoors or an elevator, its like WTF... Chinese-Americans would never do that. I'll take an average Chinese-American girl over FOB any day of the week.
