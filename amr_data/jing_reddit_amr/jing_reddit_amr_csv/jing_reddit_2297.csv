"Your nicer than I am. I would have promised her the world. Once she left her current man, i would use her for all she worth and then discard her.

Their craving for self validation and gold digging gets then into trouble all the time. Did she have kids under ?","# ::snt Your nicer than I am. I would have promised her the world.
