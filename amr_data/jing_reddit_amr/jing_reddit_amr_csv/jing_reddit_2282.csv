"Honestly, my experience was pretty similar and I think your advice was spot on. For me, my advice to all college women is never spend any time alone with any man. Even if he's your friend, even if you think you trust him, even if he says things are cool and he doesn't like you like that. Even if he's in class with you and you really think it's just to study. You don't even want a in risk at getting raped. When it happened to me, I was just like you. My GPA plummeted, I could hardly be in public, I couldn't eat, I felt like my world had collapsed around me and I saw him every fucking day not a care in the world because he knew I had no evidence, nothing that could prove what he'd done. Just not worth it these days. I'll never get my future back, but maybe we can help them, right?","# ::snt Honestly, my experience was pretty similar and I think your advice was spot on.
