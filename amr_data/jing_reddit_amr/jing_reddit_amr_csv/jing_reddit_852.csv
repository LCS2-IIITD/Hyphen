"This is the kind of move that makes third party devs drop you. >While AAA titles like Grand Theft Auto V and Call of Duty feature endless amount of humans to murder, gratuitous violence seems to be totally fine in the eyes on Sonys corporate decision makers despite the fact that tragedies resulting from gun violence happen on a daily basis. Which doesn't make sense since the woke crowd get pissy about violence too (TLoU2, Tomb Raider, even Detroit: BH etc).
