"Note how Twitter and Facebook were never shut down following a mass shooting of any kind due to the usage of the perp. Like, Alexandre Bissonnette, the asshole responsible for the Quebec mosque shooting, was well known to troll Facebook groups. He was a major Facebook user. And yet, no one blamed Facebook for that horror, now did they? The truth is that Twitter and Facebook are both upper classes approved and they don't want alternatives to exist. They want control, and those platform provide it.","# ::snt Note how Twitter and Facebook were never shut down following a mass shooting of any kind due to the usage of the perp.
