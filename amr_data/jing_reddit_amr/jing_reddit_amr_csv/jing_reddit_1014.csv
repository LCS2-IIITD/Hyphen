"As a gay person, I only see homosexuality as ""people who prefer fucking people of their own sex"". There's no more to it than that; it's not quantum mechanics or the influence of Bach on later composers. So, to me, *every* opinion on homosexuality is meaningless.

Like racism? Remember when it was a feeling of superiority towards another race or showing extreme prejudice based on race? Now they move the goal posts on what racism means so that only white people can be racist because muh power. Even tho we just had a black president for years. Could black people be racist then?
