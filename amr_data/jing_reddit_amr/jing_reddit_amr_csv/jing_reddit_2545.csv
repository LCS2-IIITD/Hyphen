"What a well articulated argument. Interestingly enough meat doesnt have a particularly strong flavor given that most meat based dishes are heavily seasoned with plants. But its not like I dont appreciate that meat can be tasty. How could you not care about your health, risk of disease, or the health of our planet and the impact that global climate change will have on you and your posterity? It seems short sighted at best. Its fine if you dont want to have a fact based conversation about it, but unfortunately the levels at which Americans consume meat and our processes by which we raise that meat is having a massively detrimental effect on the health of or population and the health of our planet. Thats not an opinion. You can chose to ignore it and only retort with insights about how much you like the taste of meat, but the facts remain, that youre selfishly choosing taste and self gratification over whats best for you, the planet, animals, and your posterity. Youre better than that. We cant eat candy every meal. And we cant eat meat every meal.","# ::snt What a well articulated argument.

">Its only relatively recent that meat consumption became a staple of our diets. Not really, humans are omnivores and as hunter-gatherers we ate a diet that was a mix of vegetable matter and meat. Actually it was only after the agricultural revolution in Neolithic times that we see a significant proportion of the human population routinely NOT eating meat and that was extremely detrimental to their health by all metrics. Humans not only need to eat meat, but humans need to hunt in order to stay connected to their traditional and ancestral folkways. What does need to change however is just the insane sheer volume of meat that is consumed (meat with every meal? really?) and of course the nasty factory-farmed processed meat that's so popular in grocery stores. Personally I am all about farming and hunting. I am a Canadian Trump supporter.","# ::snt >Its only relatively recent that meat consumption became a staple of our diets.
