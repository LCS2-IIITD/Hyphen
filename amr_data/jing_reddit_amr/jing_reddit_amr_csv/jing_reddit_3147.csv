"I use the term ""feminist"" incredibly lightly because I don't feel that's the word that we should be using to describe these people, but that's almost exactly what happens when they latch onto a topic. It started out as a platform that would empower victims and let them know that there was support- basically saying, ""You're not at fault and you deserve to feel relieved about getting this off your chest"". Then *they* showed up. It wasn't long before the metoo movement became a joke, because these awful awful people decided that the platform was actually a pissing contest over who had it worse when a guy at the mall looked at their cleavage.","# ::snt I use the term ""feminist"" incredibly lightly because I don't feel that's the word that we should be using to describe these people, but that's almost exactly what happens when they latch onto a topic.
