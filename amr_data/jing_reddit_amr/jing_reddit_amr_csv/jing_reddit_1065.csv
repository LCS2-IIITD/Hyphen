"I completely agree with you. The biggest threat to humanity is the sheer number of people who reproduce despite having nothing to contribute to the collective human gene pool. Banning single mothers from having kids would be a step in the right direction. The overwhelming majority of unwed mothers tend to be women that men are happy to f but wouldn't want to marry. Not only does this result in the child having an inferior mother, it results in the child having no father as daddy is off f another ho. I have always said that banning single motherhood would be the single greatest advancement in child welfare of all time.","# ::snt I completely agree with you.
