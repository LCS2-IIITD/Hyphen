Comparing RDR2 to Gone Home in any way is insulting the hundreds if not thousands of people who developed the game over so many years of work. Even one house in RDR2 probably has more man hours and effort put into it than the entirety of Gone Home. THis is really the dumbest fucking thing I've heard all year. How can anyone be this stupid and delusional?,"# ::snt Comparing RDR2 to Gone Home in any way is insulting the hundreds if not thousands of people who developed the game over so many years of work.
