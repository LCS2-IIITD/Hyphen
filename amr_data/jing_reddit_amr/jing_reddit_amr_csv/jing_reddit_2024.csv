"first of all, islam is not a race. secondly, explain to me how a muslim being exposed to christian prayer in a catholic school and saying that's not ok is a sign of their tolerance towards us. and lastly, canada suits us just fine. i think we'll stay here and fight for what's ours. since you're clearly such a virtuous and knowledgeable person, maybe *you* should leave canada. i'd propose saudi arabia, somalia or venezuela you dumb fuck.","# ::snt first of all, islam is not a race. secondly, explain to me how a muslim being exposed to christian prayer in a catholic school and saying that's not ok is a sign of their tolerance towards us. and lastly, canada suits us just fine. i think we'll stay here and fight for what's ours. since you're clearly such a virtuous and knowledgeable person, maybe *you* should leave canada. i'd propose saudi arabia, somalia or venezuela you dumb fuck.
