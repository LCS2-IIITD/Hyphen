"God I hate most of the KiA userbase. Jesus. The lot of you dumb as shit sometimes, and I'm frankly embarrassed to have even a single view in common with you idiots. If my irl friends had the same views as many of you, I'd either move or kill myself. **That's how I know I'm not just circlejerking in some ideological bubble.** I also guarantee that at least some of the people that would recognize my name on here do so because they think I'm dumb as a sack of rocks and as close to a SJW as you can get while still being on this sub every day. I'm pretty lucky that I don't actually hate people as much as others do. My irl friends are legit ""genocide now"" tier mad sometimes and I'm like ""we literally only have first world problems. Cool your shit"". I also don't get mad while driving, which is apparently a superpower. Like, what's getting mad going to do?","# ::snt God I hate most of the KiA userbase. Jesus.
