"I doubt that this writer have much knowledge of some the anime brought up in this article. >The long-running series Mobile Suit Gundam, known for constantly reinventing itself since the late s, almost always features an antagonistic sovereign state based on a jingoistic, WWII-era Germany. Sure Zeon and its follow ups are inspired by WWII-era Germany but otherwise most series lacks such states. You could maybe make case of SEED's ZAFT being such a case due to taking heavy inspiration from MSG Zeon but it also have some differences that make such claims harder to make. Gundam X's Space Revolutionary Army could be stretched to maybe fit due to again taking inspiration from Zeon but the series don't really focus much time on that faction so it's hard to know. I don't think you find such state in G, Wing, Turn A or , maybe cases could be made for AGE, Reconguista in G or Iron-Blooded Orphans I haven't completed them so I don't know but even if so that still plenty of series that lack such states which makes saying ""almost always"" a bit much. >Legend of the Galactic Heroes, a Japanese novel series adapted into multiple anime shows, also contains a similar government called the Galactic Empire. I wouldn't say the Galactic Empire is primarily inspired by a WWII-era Germany but rather century Prussia or the German Empire with the focus on how important nobility is to advance in the ranks of the Galactic Empire. >Hetalia: Axis Powers portrays a group of anthropomorphized countries with a sympathetic, long-suffering Germany as the main character. I think saying Germany is the main character is kinda disingenuous, saying that Germany is a main character is totally fine but the only one that really can qualify as the main character is Italy.","# ::snt I doubt that this writer have much knowledge of some the anime brought up in this article. >The long-running series Mobile Suit Gundam, known for constantly reinventing itself since the late s, almost always features an antagonistic sovereign state based on a jingoistic, WWII-era Germany.
