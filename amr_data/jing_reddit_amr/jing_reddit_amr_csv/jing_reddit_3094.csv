"Its convenient but will definitely get you some weird looks in places outside the south. I'm from new england and if you use y'all in a sentence there, there's a good chance people will openly laugh in your face. Not in a mean way, it just sounds so twangy and hillbillyish to us. I live in Colorado now and plenty of people say y'all, I still have to hold back the laughter sometimes.","# ::snt Its convenient but will definitely get you some weird looks in places outside the south.
