"This procedure should be illegal. When will people realize that the foreskin is there for a reason? It has a protective function on an infant (hence why its literally stuck on the glans at that age, it works as a sterile package to PREVENT infections from feces and urine to the glans, that is why you NEVER forcibly retract and just clean/wipe like a finger) and later has a major sexual advantage for the man and his partner? Removing it is thus HARMFUL to a child. If an adult wants to skin their dick, they are free to do so. But doing it to an infant is stupid at best and evil at worst.","# ::snt This procedure should be illegal. When will people realize that the foreskin is there for a reason?
