"> The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority. How does the rise in other ethnicities explain away the increasing trend of intermarriage as evidence of immigrants' children mingling? We're looking at the effects of increased diversity, so the increase in other ethnicities is a given. The question is whether they stay clustered or mingle. Are you really trying to say that Whites aren't participating in these intermarriages? > The most common racial or ethnic pairing among newlywed intermarried couples is one Hispanic and one white spouse (42%). Next most common are one white and one Asian spouse (15%) and one white and one multiracial spouse (12%). Looks like we're all mingling! Or, is that what really bothers you? > Depends on the immigrants, not all immigrants are weighed equally. This is the part people like you always forget. For example, Jamaican and Haitian immigrants commit way more crime than Dutch and German immigrants. Literally zero people on the Right are claiming all immigrants are the same, but it is statistically more likely for Mexican immigrants to commit crime than Japanese people. Those are numbers you cannot debate, which is likely why you strawman the conservative position. If you think that ethnicity itself drives criminal behaviour, then you're being blatantly racist. Crime rates are driven by inequality, and inequality often breaks along ethnic lines. That's the only reason there is any correlation between crime rates and ethnicity. Sadly, this widespread confusion fuels policies which see Canadian police forces funded, not based on actual crime rates, but based on the (mis)perceived threats posed by minorities. The point isn't to judge individuals based on what groups they belong to. It's to build the kinds of communities that produce less crime. Spoiler: those are diverse democracies with lower inequality and socialist policies. > Diversity for the sake of diversity is not a strength. That is retarded. There is absolutely no data to back that up. If you believe so, you will have to explain to us how blacks, jews, and indians have different brains than whites. You'll have to explain how on a genetic level they are different, as well as cultural. To argue for diversity being a strength, you are in fact arguing for racism. Not sure why I would have to explain anything about various brains, especially since I already cited evidence showing that more diverse communities with more immigrants have less crime. Maybe take a few breathes and revisit that PBS link. I'm not saying ""diversity at all costs,"" any more than you're saying ""all immigration is bad."" But generally increased diversity IS good. There is evidence for that. You're just refusing to look at it.","# ::snt > The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority.

">How does the rise in other ethnicities explain away the increasing trend of intermarriage as evidence of immigrants' children mingling? Because here is how it works: there are races, and within those races are ethnicities that are closer than ethnicities than other races. For example, Japanese marrying Chinese is more common than French and Chinese. Jamaican and Ethiopian is more common than Korean and Haitian. Irish and German is more common than Mexican and Nigerian. So you see, it depends how detailed the metrics are. The fact of the matter is, broadly asian and broadly white and broadly black and broadly south american are no closer than they have ever been. In fact, conflicts are worse than ever before. Both in the West and globally. Pan-African supremacist movements are at an all time strength in the US. Nation of Islam openly states that white people are subhuman mutants, but they see all Africans and Caribbeans as brothers and sisters. Pan-European white supremacist movements see the entirety of Europeans as one group. Welcome to the world as it is now. >The most common racial or ethnic pairing among newlywed intermarried couples is one Hispanic and one white spouse (42%). Next most common are one white and one Asian spouse (15%) and one white and one multiracial spouse (12%). This actually proves my point, the funny thing is you don't even see it because you don't understand this situation. White people see Hispanics as *closer genetically* than blacks. Closer *genetically* than Indians, than Arabs. The thing you fail to recognize is that everyone subconsciously understands this ranking of races that I just outlined, and that even within the *small minority* of interracial marriages they overwhelmingly trend towards people who are genetically white, or appear more white. What do you think about that? >If you think that ethnicity itself drives criminal behaviour, then you're being blatantly racist. I guess racism is correct. >Crime rates are driven by inequality, and inequality often breaks along ethnic lines. Wrong, inequality is not an analog measure, it is an infinite fractal and inadmissible as a scientific ranking. One cannot ""rate"" how unequal one group is to another, there are too many metrics. It's clear to me that people like you are so comfortable with using these words you have never actually thought about how complicated they are. How do you measure a gay Korean against an orphaned Congolese? A trans German who is poor against a trans Jamaican who is rich? And compare both of them to a trans Aboriginal in a wheelchair?

"> In fact, conflicts are worse than ever before. No, they aren't. We're actually experiencing an unprecedented peace. Where are you getting your information from, the fearmongers at Fox, Brietbart, and Rebel? > The thing you fail to recognize is that everyone subconsciously understands this ranking of races that I just outlined, and that even within the small minority of interracial marriages they overwhelmingly trend towards people who are genetically white, or appear more white. The original question was simply whether different ethnicities are mingling or staying clustered, and the INCREASING intermarriages shows they are in fact INCREASINGLY mingling. You challenged my claim, but you're not addressing that point at all. What you're doing is injecting your own White supremacist argument, which also misses the point. Marriage is largely an economic decision, and since economics have artificially broken along ethnic lines, we would expect preferences for stable economic partners to manifest as preference for ""Whiter"" spouses. Likewise, if Blacks are being persecuted with so many of their young men thrown behind bars and denied equity in society, then that likely artificially affects their desirability as mates. This economic factor would explain why Black men with more education intermarry more. Or, a culture of racism (even subconscious) rather than accurate ranking might cause people to prefer White mates. How many families explicitly/implicitly make it difficult for someone to bring home a Black gf/bf? Or, there are just more White people. But whatever the reason, they are mingling, so my point stands. What your argument also fails to address is the fact that, until fairly recently, plenty of genetically and apparently similar groups, like the Irish and Italians, weren't considered White. And South Asians, who are genetically Caucasian, aren't usually considered White. Therefore, ""Whiteness"" itself is largely a social construct, not some inherent ranking system like you're saying. > I guess racism is correct. At least you have the courage to say what you believe. A shame you lack the wisdom to see you're wrong. Seriously, though, does it frustrate you that more people who agree with you aren't willing to be honest about what they believe? Some people seem more offended at being called racist than they are at actually being racist. Do you feel that r/metacanada is a place where your beliefs are generally supported? If not, then why not? > Wrong, inequality is not an analog measure, it is an infinite fractal and inadmissible as a scientific ranking. I could have been more precise in saying economic inequality within communities drives crime, which is the consensus among the research. > It showed that for violent crime the impact of inequality is large, even after controlling for the effects of poverty, race, and family composition. Although most crimes are committed by the most disadvantaged members of society, these individuals face greater pressure and incentives to commit crime in areas of high inequality. (is that link better?) Do you have any actual peer-reviewed, credible research to show that ethnicity itself drives crime? While you're looking for that, you'll notice the consensus agrees with me. > Yeah, because increased police presence is an deterrent to crime. Perhaps, but the best way to predict the size of a police force in Canada is the presence of minorities, not the actual crime rate. That means the reason for the increased presence isn't to deter actual crime, but to respond to an imagined threat of crime that does not actually exist. Completely the opposite of what you're saying here: > BECAUSE THE INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE IN MINORITY AREAS IS BECAUSE THOSE MINORITIES COMMIT MORE CRIMES. You're simply asserting what you're trying to argue (begging the question) which is the opposite of what the evidence clearly says. Why do you keep dodging the point at hand? Baltimore only shows how inequality with corrupt police create a vicious cycle of violence and mistrust. The police there intentionally made their communities more dangerous to prove their own value. It's like when police stop writing tickets to starve the government of funds during labour disputes. That's simply self-serving stupidity, not a case against the expansive research on the actual causes of crime. > You did not. Multicultural cities have more crime, especially interracial crime. Especially crime where blacks assault whites and other blacks. They are uniformly more violent than every other race and ethnicity. Stop sidestepping this blatantly obvious fact. That's not true at all. I keep giving you evidence, and you respond with invective. Toronto is both one of the most multicultural cities in the world, and one of the safest. Take a look at some recent data from across Canada. The top of those lists aren't the most multicultural places.

Where are you getting your information from, the fearmongers at Fox, Brietbart, and Rebel? > The thing you fail to recognize is that everyone subconsciously understands this ranking of races that I just outlined, and that even within the small minority of interracial marriages they overwhelmingly trend towards people who are genetically white, or appear more white. The original question was simply whether different ethnicities are mingling or staying clustered, and the INCREASING intermarriages shows they are in fact INCREASINGLY mingling. You challenged my claim, but you're not addressing that point at all. What you're doing is injecting your own White supremacist argument, which also misses the point. Marriage is largely an economic decision, and since economics have artificially broken along ethnic lines, we would expect preferences for stable economic partners to manifest as preference for ""Whiter"" spouses. Likewise, if Blacks are being persecuted with so many of their young men thrown behind bars and denied equity in society, then that likely artificially affects their desirability as mates. This economic factor would explain why Black men with more education intermarry more. Or, a culture of racism (even subconscious) rather than accurate ranking might cause people to prefer White mates. How many families explicitly/implicitly make it difficult for someone to bring home a Black gf/bf? Or, there are just more White people. But whatever the reason, they are mingling, so my point stands. What your argument also fails to address is the fact that, until fairly recently, plenty of genetically and apparently similar groups, like the Irish and Italians, weren't considered White. And South Asians, who are genetically Caucasian, aren't usually considered White. Therefore, ""Whiteness"" itself is largely a social construct, not some inherent ranking system like you're saying. > I guess racism is correct. At least you have the courage to say what you believe. A shame you lack the wisdom to see you're wrong. Seriously, though, does it frustrate you that more people who agree with you aren't willing to be honest about what they believe? Some people seem more offended at being called racist than they are at actually being racist. Do you feel that r/metacanada is a place where your beliefs are generally supported? If not, then why not? > Wrong, inequality is not an analog measure, it is an infinite fractal and inadmissible as a scientific ranking. I could have been more precise in saying economic inequality within communities drives crime, which is the consensus among the research. > It showed that for violent crime the impact of inequality is large, even after controlling for the effects of poverty, race, and family composition. Although most crimes are committed by the most disadvantaged members of society, these individuals face greater pressure and incentives to commit crime in areas of high inequality. (is that link better?) Do you have any actual peer-reviewed, credible research to show that ethnicity itself drives crime? While you're looking for that, you'll notice the consensus agrees with me. > Yeah, because increased police presence is an deterrent to crime. Perhaps, but the best way to predict the size of a police force in Canada is the presence of minorities, not the actual crime rate. That means the reason for the increased presence isn't to deter actual crime, but to respond to an imagined threat of crime that does not actually exist. Completely the opposite of what you're saying here: > BECAUSE THE INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE IN MINORITY AREAS IS BECAUSE THOSE MINORITIES COMMIT MORE CRIMES. You're simply asserting what you're trying to argue (begging the question) which is the opposite of what the evidence clearly says. Why do you keep dodging the point at hand? Baltimore only shows how inequality with corrupt police create a vicious cycle of violence and mistrust. The police there intentionally made their communities more dangerous to prove their own value. It's like when police stop writing tickets to starve the government of funds during labour disputes. That's simply self-serving stupidity, not a case against the expansive research on the actual causes of crime. > You did not. Multicultural cities have more crime, especially interracial crime. Especially crime where blacks assault whites and other blacks. They are uniformly more violent than every other race and ethnicity. Stop sidestepping this blatantly obvious fact. That's not true at all. I keep giving you evidence, and you respond with invective. Toronto is both one of the most multicultural cities in the world, and one of the safest. Take a look at some recent data from across Canada. The top of those lists aren't the most multicultural places. They are places like in Alberta where they rely on boom/bust economies, which exacerbate economic inequality. > The data shows otherwise.
