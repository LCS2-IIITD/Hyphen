"Don't get me wrong, she acted like an asshole. While her apology might seem like a PR move, it's at least more than you normally get from these bitches who call the cops on black people for existing in their space. I think this woman is an asshole, and I don't think this kid needs to forgive her. In fact, nobody has to forgive anyone who falsely accuses them of something *if* the intention was to defame or damage. If it was a genuine mistake, I think forgiveness could be encouraged.","# ::snt Don't get me wrong, she acted like an asshole.
