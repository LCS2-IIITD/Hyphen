"The reason you werent crying enough is because you werent terrified, Very simple, you are mocking women who have endured real pain of not consenting. Try being five years old , pinned down and forcefully penetrated. Followed by eighteen years of silence. I lost my voice because of that. I wish I could have said something, but I felt that it was my own fault. The nerve of you, please take your pitty party somewhere else!","# ::snt The reason you werent crying enough is because you werent terrified, Very simple, you are mocking women who have endured real pain of not consenting.
