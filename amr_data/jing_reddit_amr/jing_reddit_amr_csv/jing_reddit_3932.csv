"You are an actual piece of fucking garbage. Just checked your comment history and the fact you say things like ""die Jew die"" show that you're some Nazi piece of shit. Honestly wish you fucks would just come together grow a pair of balls and come out of the shadows so the world can stomp your ass out again stop hiding on Reddit threads,Facebook comments, and your Nazi rallies. Grow a pair and try some shit. It's been a long time coming for military service members to actually fight a domestic enemy and you Nazi dirtbags are one of them. So I'll say again. Grow a pair and come out of the shadows fuckboys and I promise you'll see what this country is made of real fuckin quick. Edit: changed redneck rallies to Nazi rallies since most rednecks are good people with good BBQ.","# ::snt You are an actual piece of fucking garbage.
