"No dude. She took two falls from slight shoulder brushes and nudges. There is no way in hell this one, annoying drunk lady is a threat. If she is angry, you, as an officer of the law, should try to de-escalate the situation. What you dont do is stoop to her level and open a can of whoop ass. Cuff her tackle her if you have to, toss her in the drunk tank. What you dont do is give her brain damage. Whether she deserves it or not is completely besides the point. Youre a cop AND youre a man.

"Okay cool. Sounds like shell get charged and she deserves that. Does she deserve to get beaten by the cop, who has or other cops within striking distance? Absolutely not. You make it seem like this drunk lady has the aim and the capability to scratch an eye put. So if the absolute worst that lady could have done is scratch an eye out, then the absolute worst the cop could have done was kill her if youre fine with that, then whatever. Youll gladly support the police going around, killing people whilly-nilly when they, the police, feel justified. You would also be telling me that youre fine with one man being the judge, jury, and executioner. I dunno how it works out in holland, but here it is innocent until proven guilty IN FRONT OF A COURT OF LAW. Not, in front of the police, not in front of a bunch of misogynistic nerds on reddit. Yes, it was done blatantly, on video, in front of tons of witnesses great. More evidence to use IN COURT. Tackle her, cuff her, charge her. Dont kill her. Dont beat her. Be better than her. Use the officer training that you were supposed to have received and de-escalate the situation by cuffing her not beating her to a pulp. But whatever. Fine. If a cop ever uses excessive force on you or a loved you, you have no right to get mad about it because, according to you and the dutch, they can NEVER be wrong if they are wrong, the other person is even MORE wrong, therefore, apparently, the cop is right. According to you, and the dutch, two wrongs somehow make a right. It was excessive force. The lady needed to be punished, but not like that. There are cops right there. Try to explain to me how cops cant apprehend one drunk woman. If they cant they need better training. Let me ask you: whats the point of the judicial system, according to you? Honestly? Whats the point? If the police are never wrong and every arrest they make is correct, and every beating they give is justified, why even have court proceedings? Why not just toss em in the brig?","# ::snt Okay cool. Sounds like shell get charged and she deserves that. Does she deserve to get beaten by the cop, who has or other cops within striking distance?

"Police don't need prove to restrain or use force on an aggressive person who is evading arrest, that's the same here as it is in Holland.

Police aren't going to take risks infront of a crowd with agressive people trying to hurt them, male or female. Killings by cop aren't common at all in Holland, like i said this is not the USA. It very rarely happens, not even one this year. The cops were there for crowd control, as you can clearly see in the video. This is standard procedure. As little as possible arrest while the others make sure the crowd disperses. Cops won't use excessive force on me or a loved one as, like i said, cops are the most respected and trusted authority in the country. They score higher than other people and even neighbours. Things like this are very rare and excessive force therefore even more. She could walk and stand fine, there was no excessive force here, just the most efficient way to handle the situation. Even if the arrest wasn't correct, she abused the cop. The arrest can be wrong all you want, we both don't know, but because she abused the cop this was completely legal and no one will even look into it guarenteed. You respect cops here, even if they're wrong. If you're wrongfully arrested and you behave well you will most likely go free, there's a reason our prisoners per capita is one of the lowest in the world. Our judicial system is great. This is not the USA. Here's an article about our prisons closing because we have too little prisoners. People here don't have to fear cops or the judicial system so things like this are rare and severely judged by the public.

"You really like putting words in my mouth haha, fascism, saying i would defend cops killing for no reason, saying i think cops are always right. It's clear that you're more of an emotional than a rational person, that's alright, but can you maybe base a single argument on something i actually said instead of just assuming everything? I never said any of that. You're assuming the cop thinks she's a lethal threat. Again, i'm sorry, but that's another dumb assumption. What is it with you and over the top assumptions? She is a threat, no one said anything about lethal. Ironic how easily you assume things about what i think but you can't assume the cops handled the situation in a proper fashion before the video began. You really have no idea what you're talking about, you're only defending her because she's such a fragile woman. Get over yourself, she abused a cop, this is justified by law and by public opinion. Crowd control is not something done only when crowds get aggressive, it's always done in case crowds get aggressive. It's called preventing a dangerous situation and it shouldn't be that hard to fathom. She was already under arrest, don't you understand that? She RESISTED ARREST. The didn't punch her first, arrested her after. They arrested her, she didn't comply with the arrest so they had to take physical actions. If you don't even know what an arrest is it's hard to talk reason with you. Arrest is verbal. When an officer says you're under arrest, you are arrested. She bothers the cops, is pushed away, she hits the cop, he defends, then she's arrested and then she hits the cop again, resisting arrest. You are one to talk about police violence, look at your own numbers and then look at ours, it's clear to see that lethal force is astronomically less common here than in the USA. Punching someone who punches cops is standard procedure everywhere. Tackling is way more dangerous, cop will be on the floor in a vulnerable position. But you don't understand anything about how police do their job so it's logical your emotions get the best of you. The cops are better than the people they arrested. Those people were being aggressive in bars, the handcuffed the first person without problems, then made sure the woman wasn't a threat anymore either. This woman, like you said, was in the wrong, and the cops were better. Cops should be better, and here they clearly were? The didn't attack anyone unprovoked (woman did) they only retaliated (woman instigated multiple times) and they remained professional and controlled the situation. Your entire argument is based on me saying police are always right, funny thing is i never once said that. You are an emotional person and paint the worst picture of the cops, and me, in your head with all your assumptions. Your argument is based on zero facts. Non-lethal measures against aggressive people resisting arrest within reason is never excessive force. It's amazing how you bend the facts so extremely. Everything you say ""i have told you"" i literally did not say and do not believe. You are arguing against an enemy you made up in your own head. Saying that police can't act until there's been a trial is ridiculous and you know that, don't play dumb. Cops have to act in an instance to take out a threat to ensure the safety of themselves and others, they did the right thing and you can't accept that because she's only a fragile woman (who ATTACKED COPS MULTIPLE TIMES)","# ::snt You really like putting words in my mouth haha, fascism, saying i would defend cops killing for no reason, saying i think cops are always right. It's clear that you're more of an emotional than a rational person, that's alright, but can you maybe base a single argument on something i actually said instead of just assuming everything? I never said any of that. You're assuming the cop thinks she's a lethal threat. Again, i'm sorry, but that's another dumb assumption. What is it with you and over the top assumptions? She is a threat, no one said anything about lethal. Ironic how easily you assume things about what i think but you can't assume the cops handled the situation in a proper fashion before the video began. You really have no idea what you're talking about, you're only defending her because she's such a fragile woman. Get over yourself, she abused a cop, this is justified by law and by public opinion. Crowd control is not something done only when crowds get aggressive, it's always done in case crowds get aggressive. It's called preventing a dangerous situation and it shouldn't be that hard to fathom. She was already under arrest, don't you understand that? She RESISTED ARREST. The didn't punch her first, arrested her after. They arrested her, she didn't comply with the arrest so they had to take physical actions. If you don't even know what an arrest is it's hard to talk reason with you. Arrest is verbal. When an officer says you're under arrest, you are arrested.

"Im just hung up on the beating being warranted in any way, shape or form. It doesnt de-escalate the situation at all. Its essentially senseless considering the means with which the police have to apprehend people. And, if its not senseless then its inefficient. The cop could tackle the lady, the other cops would swarm her, over power her, and have her in a squad car before the video is even over. But fine. Maybe its a cultural disconnect, like you said. You always side with police no matter what, and I always side with not beating people for not much of a reason other than to hit back for the sake of hitting back. Just because someone hits you, it doesnt mean you hit them back. Is it within the cops right? Absolutely. Again, that doesnt mean he should do it. Look at the size of the cop compared to her. She is treated like a rag-doll when he handled her. Instead of doing all of that, making a huge fuss, causing people to run, the cop could have capped it and ended it there by tackling her to the ground, and cuffing her. And look, the woman is completely at fault. She deserves her punishment in a court or however you do it in holland. She deserves her time, and that, I believe, is justice. The root of that fuss is obviously coming from her, she is the biggest factor in the fuss. The thing is, the cops contribute to the fuss. If it was up to me, that would not be an officers purpose. You try your best not to contribute violence in a situation when you dont need to and the officer really did need to at all. If you think he did, I still need you to rationally explain how a drunk lady can do more than a black eye on a cop. If she had a weapon, you would think she would have drawn it after a punch or two. But she didnt, so maybe at that point you stop punching her and just cuff her. Then again, maybe not. You guys handle your women however you want, I guess. I wont tell you what to, and what not to do with them. The base of my argument is that I just believe the police can, and should do better than that. They shouldnt have to beat people in order to get them to comply. Its not their job to injure criminals, its their job to apprehend them. The only times I feel it IS warranted is life or death situations, riots, or a raid. But, presumably you raid with guns, so I dont know why there would be a beating involved. But I digress. Finally, I guess Ill apologize. I get a little emotional when I get in a political debate. Maybe it really is just cause were from different parts of the world.","# ::snt Im just hung up on the beating being warranted in any way, shape or form. It doesnt de-escalate the situation at all.
