"I disagree and feel that him being gay adds more depth to the series, though it has been a while since I read it so I am misremembering stuff, I also never watched the movies. I felt that it made more sense, given his past with Grindlewald, for him to be looking out for dark Lord behavior and thus act so extremely towards Toms behaviour in the orphanage, where most people would assume the environment had made him this way, not that it was innately him. Being a fag hag might be gross to you, fair enough. I just enjoy the gay culture though I'm not involved myself, and I like seeing them represented, especially when it can make sense canonically. This is a weird conversation but I don't think we'll come to an agreement. I'm ok that some people don't care for the reveal and don't think it adds anything, I'm just of the opposite camp. Have a good day.","# ::snt I disagree and feel that him being gay adds more depth to the series, though it has been a while since I read it so I am misremembering stuff, I also never watched the movies.
