"Only some feminists. Most are logical people and actually have strong reasons and evidence behind their opinions. Take Malala Yousafzai for example. She stood up for women who wanted to go to school in Pakistan, has done amazing things, and doesnt get triggered like your stereotypical feminist does, even though she herself is a feminist. Thats just one example. Bottom line, you have people painting feminists to be horrible and always triggered but a good few of them are completely fine","# ::snt Only some feminists.
