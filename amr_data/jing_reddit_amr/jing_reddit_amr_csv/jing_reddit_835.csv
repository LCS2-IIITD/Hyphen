Freedom of speech is dangerous it allows people to be informed or misinformed on the state of world and they might want to do something about it and they might just think violence is the best way of going about that despite the heavy pacifist element in our culture.,"# ::snt Freedom of speech is dangerous it allows people to be informed or misinformed on the state of world and they might want to do something about it and they might just think violence is the best way of going about that despite the heavy pacifist element in our culture.

"Lack of freedom of speech is much more dangerous. Laws against speech do not change minds, they only enhance resentment and increase radicalization, driving subversive movements underground. When people can't express their greivances, real or imagined, with words, they go straight to violence. It's like putting the lid on a pressure cooker. Speech must be free in all public and common areas, the government cannot be allowed to restrict speech. Only on private property can speech be restricted and there the only acceptable method of enforcement is to eject the violator from the property.","# ::snt Lack of freedom of speech is much more dangerous.
