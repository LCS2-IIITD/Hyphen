"Great poll about how people feel. Of course girls in general can't play most (physically demanding) sports as well as boys...they simply aren't built to. This is like saying that you are discriminating against a screwdriver when pointing out it's not as good at driving nails, while, in fact it's actual purpose at times is driving a superior fastener (screws). This brings me to a point that isn't brought up enough...nobody...NOBODY hates women more than today's feminists. They take everything that women typically excel at and roles that are typically women's which are absolutely essential to properly running a household in tandem with a partner and they devalue them and demonize them to the point where women feel ashamed to have those traits. Then they try and make men feel guilty for valuing those traits...because of course valuing something is forcing it upon people.","# ::snt Great poll about how people feel.
