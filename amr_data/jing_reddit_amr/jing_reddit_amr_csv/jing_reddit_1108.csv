"See, this is the way I think can best describe this to women (I have not tested on a woman so this is just theory). First strip down to your underwear because pants will not give the same effect as even a light tap to the balls with clothes on. Lay spread eagle on a bed at the edge. Have the strongest man you know make a fist but with his middle fingers second knuckle pointed out (but still making a fist). Then have him punch you as hard as he can directly on your clit. That is the best way I can think of conveying to a woman what it feels like to get hit in the balls. The follow up constant numb dull horrible ache I guess would be your worst cramp on your heaviest period you've had - and no Midol.","# ::snt See, this is the way I think can best describe this to women (I have not tested on a woman so this is just theory).
