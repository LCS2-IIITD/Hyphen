"I see your point but I'm still gonna give it a try. And there definitely is misogyny here, don't bs me. The fact that there are more divorces now is just linked to the fact that women now have access to jobs and can provide for themselves,allowing them to escape shitty marriages, which is a good thing imo. The biggest mistake people do is getting married too early, after or years together, without even living together prior to wedding. That's why I'm gonna take all the time I need, to be sure it will work.","# ::snt I see your point but I'm still gonna give it a try. And there definitely is misogyny here, don't bs me.

"Dude I'm not American, all those laws you cited (that are outrageous btw, don't get me wrong on that) don't apply to my country. No child pension, no splitting of goods.

Your life isn't thrilling, you are cleaning the house, coocking, etc. Your husband (who is providing for you, for everything) doesn't gives a shit about you anymore, never spends time with you, cheats on you, whatever. You have no education, certainly can't get a job cause you are a woman in the 's with no professional experience, no diploma. Can you divorce ? Do you have a choice ? Yes : stay in this sad life, or divorce and become homeless, and a social pariah on top of that. Therefore no divorce. Nowadays ?

"My bad on the law, I was partially wrong. We do have the splitting of goods (or not, depending on the type of divorce and marriage contract). However, no child support. If the divorced wife can't support the kid, she just won't have custody. About numbers, i use INSEE, the french public statistics institute. You can look it up (translate the page if you can't read french). Check the divorce rate in th century and you will see it it follows directly the employment rate of women.

In the US, if you fail to register for Selective Service you can be put in prison and denied all sorts of things like student loans and the ability to go to higher education. You could also be denied home loans for failing to register while all a woman needs is to be born and have a vagina. Sounds like equality right? Shall we reject the statements from slaves and only listen to the slave owners? That is what you are saying moron.
