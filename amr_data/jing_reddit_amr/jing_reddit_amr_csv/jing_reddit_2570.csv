"Wow. That fuking luxury. Just h. You got on a list. You waited your turn. Your turn was always skipped. If you were not prezent, you got a vizit from the boys in blue and got whooped until you spilled the beans on the location of the food. Now a funny joke. years ago, reality. Unless you had connections like mad you died of hunger. Unless you bribed the right people you get vizits. Unless you work from morning til in a factory, then, from to in the field you starved. Unless you have children you get fined. One of the funniest now, insane then, stories was the celibate tax. And it was half of EVERYTHING you made. And, in those times, there was a guy who happily payed, celibate and shit. He was the only guy in the city with a Mercedes. In retrospect, he was a legend.","# ::snt Wow. That fuking luxury. Just h.
