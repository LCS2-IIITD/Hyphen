"idiot? like I'm scientifically designated an ""idiot"" like I have the mental age of two or less? That is technically the wrong word to use. choose your words wisely fellow redditor for there are those around you who might judge you quite harshly for your insolence by daring to not get every word you say exactly correct. EDIT like did you think I thought this video was CGI or some kind of deepfake? is that why you're all up in arms about my choice of words? yeah, it's staged.","# ::snt idiot? like I'm scientifically designated an ""idiot"" like I have the mental age of two or less?
