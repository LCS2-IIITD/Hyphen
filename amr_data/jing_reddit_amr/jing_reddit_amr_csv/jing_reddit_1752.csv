"The OGFT [faggots]() are already acting like they're detectives that got to the bottom of these ""alt right hate symbols."" It's mind boggling that they're so adament that when it comes to wearing hijabs, killing babies, gay parades and crosswalks, or letting kids be trannies we can't say anything because ""it doesn't affect us"" but when these entrepreneurs and soldiers are selling stuff to willing buyers in transactions that have nothing to do with them they get high and mighty saying it must be shut down. Fucking hypocrits.","# ::snt The OGFT [faggots]() are already acting like they're detectives that got to the bottom of these ""alt right hate symbols.""
