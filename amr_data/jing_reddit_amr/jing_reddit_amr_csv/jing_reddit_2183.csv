"> here is more to the story that you aren't telling. I can easily see that you antagonized them with your words which lead to them attacking you. Nope, I don't feel sorry for you. They should have called the police and had you arrested for disturbing the peace and making violent threats then following through with assault on two people. Nope, I told him to stop threatening me and keep his distance as he was drawing near to me. That's a no-no, gtfo of my aura. They assaulted me, I defended my bodily safety.","# ::snt > here is more to the story that you aren't telling.
