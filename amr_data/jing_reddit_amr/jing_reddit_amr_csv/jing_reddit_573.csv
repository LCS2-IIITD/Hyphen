"I think the main arguments of why we see less pessimistic games are twofold. . Games are a form of escapism. Just like any other there will be more tales that end well than end badly. . AAAs will go with the happier endings more often because that's what sells better- because most gamers, most of the time, want to have fun. Not everyone is into experiencing suffering on a constant basis. I think more important than pessimism, though, is profoundness. As long as media has that one sucker punch/""oh crap I get it"" moment, it doesnt matter if it's pessimistic as a whole.","# ::snt I think the main arguments of why we see less pessimistic games are twofold. .
