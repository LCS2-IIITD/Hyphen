"I see she's demonstrating some of that famous ""strength and independence"" feminists love to talk about. She's truly strong, to get so ultra triggered over a *painting*, because it committed the unbelievable crime of having....*white men* on it! Oh the humanity! Shit like this is why I can't help but laugh when feminists talk about their beloved ""oppression"". You don't have any real problems at all, if bullshit like this is what you choose to focus all your attention on. Great job showing the world how truly hard you have it, when you cry over a painting that doesn't effect any aspect of your life, in any meaningful way, whatsoever.","# ::snt I see she's demonstrating some of that famous ""strength and independence"" feminists love to talk about.
