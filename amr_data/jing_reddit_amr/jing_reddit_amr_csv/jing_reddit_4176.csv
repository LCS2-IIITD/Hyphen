Been seeing the video a lot and it's just excessive on the cops part. No need to throw punches at a downed suspect. The other videos people took show much more than this too.,"# ::snt Been seeing the video a lot and it's just excessive on the cops part. No need to throw punches at a downed suspect.

They had two officers there who even though her verbal communication angered them were handling the situation well. Then one got a little too irritated and threw a punch. Sure it's someone being arrested but an officer should never punch a suspect they have down on the ground specially when the situation is easily controlled by them like come on it's a v1 and they have advantage. He didn't need to hit her at all it's just excessive force. It's nothing to do with emotions and more to do with acting like a properly trained officer of the law. You do not punch a suspect you have downed specially when you are stronger and outnumber them.,"# ::snt They had two officers there who even though her verbal communication angered them were handling the situation well.

"years security and investigative experience IN New Jersey here, have assisted in many many arrests and alcohol related incidents and I grew up minutes from wildwood. She wasnt going to be arrested for that twisted tea on the towel, she was at MOST going to be given a ticket if she wasnt and had the alcohol either confiscated or if her imaginary aunt showed up, and claimed the alcohol it would have been over. I've violated that same law she has before and been asked to pour out beers on that very beach. She was arrested because she was detained and was refusing compliance. Shes also a known piece of shit criminal that shouldn't have even been in New Jersey to begin with because she was probation-locked in Pennsylvania. The utter retardation of most people on reddit when it comes to this is making me crack up tbh.","# ::snt years security and investigative experience IN New Jersey here, have assisted in many many arrests and alcohol related incidents and I grew up minutes from wildwood.
