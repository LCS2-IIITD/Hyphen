">For others, a day of disappointment that the university failed to remove the source of their pain from the public sidewalk The school never had a right to remove him, because it's a public place. They made it sound like ""I'm sorry we failed to live up to your demands"" as if they were in a position to be able to do anything. This is why Crowder chooses public places where he can film the whole thing and get as much unedited evidence when people irrationally oppose what he's doing, by yelling, screaming, etc. In the full video, the girl who asked the officer to remove him also didn't seem to understand that in a public place if you're not causing any disturbance or physical threat to others, he's allowed to be there.","# ::snt >For others, a day of disappointment that the university failed to remove the source of their pain from the public sidewalk The school never had a right to remove him, because it's a public place.

"It's sort of amazing to watch the sociopathy on display here in this clip. She rotates between reasonable, smug, outraged, and distraught rapidly sometimes through hysterical tears to laughter within a matter of seconds. She's seeing which strategy will play best with the situation at hand but you can tell doesn't feel any of them besides smug very deeply if at all. Of course it would be criminal of me to not mention her attempt at accusing the officer of not caring about rape victims. She attempts to publicly shame him to either get her way or punish him for not giving in to her illegal and unconstitutional demands. It's the modern left in a nutshell. EDIT:Ten seconds from emotional breakdown to smiling at her phone EDIT : No one will actually see this edit but I wish I had written more about the ""you would ignore it if I was raped"" (summary not a quote) bit. What it really was I think was an attempt to incite a witch hunt targeting the officer. Imagine if that crowd had started screaming that, he might have gone ahead and removed Crowder to save his own hide. The mob doesn't care if the allegations are true, it's just blood in the water. It's become true for them once it's in their mind. SJW thinking is mob mentality writ large. I've been thinking a lot about this clip and how this interaction troubles me so deeply. I don't think this girl was born a sociopath, I think she grew up in a dynamic fostered by radical left wing and marxist thinking that generated this inside her.","# ::snt It's sort of amazing to watch the sociopathy on display here in this clip.
