"KiA values ideological consistency. If you're going to trumpet consumer rights, don't be a tit to consumers. It can't be that hard, yet it is and that's why the sub is still twitching four years on. Furthermore, when buying anything you weigh up value proposition and customer loyalty. What's wrong with trying to minimise the spend on a *hobby*? >I've never seen so much millennial crying and entitlement in a sub dedicated to calling out stupidity and immaturity. you must be mighty precious if you have to imagine people crying on the internet. I love low effort trolls, it keeps threads lively.","# ::snt KiA values ideological consistency. If you're going to trumpet consumer rights, don't be a tit to consumers.
