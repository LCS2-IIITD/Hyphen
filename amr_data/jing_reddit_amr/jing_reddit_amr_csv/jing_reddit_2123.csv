"There are significant antitrust issues with these actions. Gab has recourse. If our Department of Justice wasn't run by a feckless leader who still thinks it's the s, none of this would be happening. Virtually any other AG would be shoving cases up all these corporate colluders asses so far they'd be shitting regret into colostomy bags by now. Protip: The test is, ""is harm to the consumer occurring?"" All the other shit the NPC's bloviate to justify these arbitrary, specious, or retaliatory actions are just that: shit. If you want change, find your nearest red hat wearing influencer and cajole her or him into convincing their boss into firing flappy ears. For starters, if the standard set with Alex Jones, Gab and others were followed without prejudice, then Facebook, Twitter, and perhaps even Youtube would also be stripped of their hosting and payment services. But no. Why? Vertical integration? Uh oh. Time to blow the dust off of that old Hart-Scott-Rodino index. In fact, if you look at it now, there's already plenty of cause for antitrust action. Plenty. But yet, crickets. You guys can't blame anyone but the current administration. They could stop this all next week with a simple series of federal lawsuits.","# ::snt There are significant antitrust issues with these actions. Gab has recourse.
