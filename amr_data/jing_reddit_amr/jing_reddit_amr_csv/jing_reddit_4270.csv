"You say Ford was at least as believable as Kavanaugh, if not more, correct? Can you please explain which parts of her statements were supported, by evidence, as factual? You say there is a *sense* of victim blaming (so a feeling?). Based on what evidence? Or is it just a feeling without any supportive data? Not trying to be a dick, just pointing out that your statements are purely emotional.","# ::snt You say Ford was at least as believable as Kavanaugh, if not more, correct?

"Theyre not purely emotional. You cant aggregate these things into empirical data, which I dont ignore. Theres a bridge between that exists, even tho it isnt qualitative to actual numbers. We have a president, who knows as much evidence as I know about the case, publicly decrying her. So it goes both ways in assuming shes either % true or % lying. Im striking the balance. Part of judging is weight the facts and testimony. Im saying she was more believable based on comparing the twos testimony. Theres so much evidence suppressed by the WH and they absolutely continue to handcuff the investigation. And based on SHEER character, BK was belligerent and very wayward. His deflection tactics were embossed by his disgust at being questioned. His inability to cop to things he shouldnt be lying about (his drinking habits). The fact that even in his own calendar, he marked out a date that listed him hanging out with the very people Ford said were witnesses to what she claims. People have been put away for less circumstantial evidence. And again, I think, even in conjecture alone, a testimony like what BK gave would never be believed if he were the one presiding and judging over. No lawyer would ever coach a witness like that. Let alone a judge who knows exactly what to look for. (Source: family of lawyers, many of whom lean right). And again, I think overall we live in a society of victim blaming for many things, not just rape. To designate it a culture is a step to far. But theres a good enough segment of Americans who either say it wasnt a big deal, say it wasnt true (without even knowing) or if both are true, its something everyone has done. These all employ tactics to remove the blame from the accused, and to minimize the claims of the victim. Now tell me how any of this is emotionally based?","# ::snt Theyre not purely emotional.
