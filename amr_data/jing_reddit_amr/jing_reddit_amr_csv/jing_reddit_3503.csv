"He really seemed better at the time than what he turned out to be. Sort of like Obama. He did have years of training at the hands of the finest Liberals, he seemed to be really competent in the debates and legalizing weed was something the country had been screaming for since the days of Chretien. We were fooled of course, but don't let the polling numbers convince you that the country isn't outraged by his behaviour as Scheer and Singh are a bad joke at best. As for Red Green, that great Canadian seems to be spending his retirement uploading clips to youtube with his commentary so I have no complaints there. As for the CBC, if we burn their building down they'll just build another one with our tax dollars, times as expensive as the current building. We're smart in our own way. Don't get fooled by the current state of our politics. Just remember my (what-I'm-assuming is) my American friend, Trudeau is our Obama and Obama won a second term solely because he was running against a McCain-Palin ticket. Your last election could have easily been Hillary vs. Jeb if things had worked out the way that your foreign influences would have wanted. We'll figure this out. Our next great leader has already broken free and has started his own political party that will return our country to greatness.
