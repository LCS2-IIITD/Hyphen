{"label": "NOT_SARCASM", "response": "@USER Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year ‚Äô s Eve !", "context": ["1 . I ‚Äô ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ‚Äô ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is ‚Äú razor thin ‚Äù .", "2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that ‚Äô s just ‚Äú business as usual ‚Äù for Suleimani )", "3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ‚Äô s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .", "4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ‚Äô s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .", "5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .", "6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the ‚Äú far out option ‚Äù", "7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL>", "8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .", "9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : <URL>", "10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they ‚Äô re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .", "11 . But among the ‚Äú menu options ‚Äù that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . <URL>", "12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias", "13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to @USER for insight . He ‚Äô s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America ‚Äô s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :", "14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US ‚Äô posture in Iraq", "15 . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s all been downhill , ‚Äù @USER told me , in terms of America ‚Äô s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces", "16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .", "17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one ‚Äô s trying to downplay Suleimani ‚Äô s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga ."]}

I ‚Äô ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ‚Äô ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is ‚Äú razor thin ‚Äù .", "2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that ‚Äô s just ‚Äú business as usual ‚Äù for Suleimani )", "3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ‚Äô s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .", "4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ‚Äô s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .", "5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .", "6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the ‚Äú far out option ‚Äù", "7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL>", "8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .", "9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : <URL>", "10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they ‚Äô re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .", "11 . But among the ‚Äú menu options ‚Äù that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . <URL>", "12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias", "13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to @USER for insight . He ‚Äô s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America ‚Äô s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :", "14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US ‚Äô posture in Iraq", "15 . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s all been downhill , ‚Äù @USER told me , in terms of America ‚Äô s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces", "16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .", "17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one ‚Äô s trying to downplay Suleimani ‚Äô s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga ."]}
