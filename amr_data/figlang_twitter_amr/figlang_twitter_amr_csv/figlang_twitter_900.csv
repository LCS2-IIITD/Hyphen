This is a really major step forward in wrestling by having a Woman win the Men's Main Heavyweight Title . It's just a shame the story about Tessa came out when it did because it has tarnished the whole thing . I'm glad the story came out because it needed to but the timing is bad .,"# ::snt This is a really major step forward in wrestling by having a Woman win the Men's Main Heavyweight Title .
