there's a big difference between a fixed - over innings and sessions daily for days . Already cricket is so weather-affected esp . in subcont ctries . days allows a buffer day when we lose several sessions . Irreversibly changing to days will only lead to a lot of draws,"# ::snt there's a big difference between a fixed - over innings and sessions daily for days .
