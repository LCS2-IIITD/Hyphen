Please do not feel bad that you followed or were friends with that psycho . You are not to blame in any of this . It isn't your fault . I unfollowed him last night . Isn't the first time and won't be the last when it comes to following creepy people . Don't know until it's too late !,"# ::snt Please do not feel bad that you followed or were friends with that psycho . You are not to blame in any of this . It isn't your fault .
