I keep seeing the argument that Lamar Jackson could be a running back if he wanted to . I'm not sure how people justify that but it's incorrect . The amount of extra protection LJ is given and the runs he does that's not what a RB has to work with . Also Mark Ingram needs more love,"# ::snt I keep seeing the argument that Lamar Jackson could be a running back if he wanted to . I'm not sure how people justify that but it's incorrect .

He could maybe be a Theo Riddick . No I don't see why he would be . I think the same thing about Taysom hill .
