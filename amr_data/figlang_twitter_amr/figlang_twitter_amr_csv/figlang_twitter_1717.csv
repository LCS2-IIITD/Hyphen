"The timing is doesn't match the CCTV video where the missile flies ~ sec . The plane appears to be losing altitude quite fast , too fast to make it to the crash site ? Quick visual . Needs some fine tuning . <URL> <URL>",
Pink angle suggested for roughly the POV of the new vid . So how to account for the CCTV video ? <URL>,"# ::snt Pink angle suggested for roughly the POV of the new vid . So how to account for the CCTV video ? <URL>

So if this CCTV is wrong ( missile flies for ~ sec ) how can the new video be trusted ? Second missile flies for ~ seconds <URL> <URL>,"# ::snt So if this CCTV is wrong ( missile flies for ~ sec ) how can the new video be trusted ? Second missile flies for ~ seconds <URL> <URL>

Perhaps as it s simple as this ? The timing issue assumes the horizon we see in this video corresponds to launch horizon .
