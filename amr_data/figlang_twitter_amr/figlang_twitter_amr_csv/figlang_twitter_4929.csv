I don't like campaigns going negative and to this point it's been pleasant that we haven't seen it . I love both candidates so it sucks for me to see them getting negative with one another . Bernie has been doing fine without being negative . Why now when he's surging ? Strange .,"# ::snt I don't like campaigns going negative and to this point it's been pleasant that we haven't seen it .
