"So how do you power a spaceship through the void between stars ? Well , we KNOW matter is energy , but how do we get it to degrade ONLY into plasma , i . e . heat ? Also , if we found a way to stimulate energy to release copious amounts of plasma , then won't it pop in the last decay ?","# ::snt So how do you power a spaceship through the void between stars ?
