figlang_twitter_2402,PS : I m sure Israel and the US will be much more likely to cooperate with the Court now that the OTP has sought a jurisdictional ruling that will almost certainly go against Israel .,") W / benefit of time to digest , please find here my thread on jurisdictional request re & Twitter response . Sorry , & less so ... some serious pushback on its way ! <URL>::) Time to get on my hobby horse and say that the online responses to this filing again demonstrates how the court practitioner viewpoint is so underrepresented not only on Twitter , but the advocacy / policy / diplomatic / commentary community writ large .::) For those who are litigators , the wisdom & ethnics of Fatou Bensouda's filing is manifest . While Patryk alluded to it , he gave it far too little weight . There may be a difference of opinion , but OTP's move was by far the wiser .::) It would be ethnically & professionally reprehensible for OTP to go forward w / investigation , talk to witnesses & victims ( raise their exposure / protection issues ) , utilize staff time from not only OTP but other offices ( $ ) , spend large sums of money on the investigation itself , ...::) ... have to manage expectations that will undoubtedly soar no matter what , and deal w / a myriad of challenging cooperation and related complications , all for the case to collapse years later on jurisdictional issues that could have been resolved years prior .::) It is not hard to imagine the incredible backlash that would come in such a scenario ; a misstep that the / issue / lobbies would use to eat the alive . The Court must act prudently , ethically , & professionally to navigate this terrain successfully .::) To wait on this jurisdictional issue at a later juncture ( likely much later too ) has so many potential pitfalls , as described above , and would play right into the hands of realpolitik hardliners , or states wanting an "" out "" .::) Need for significant pushback on Kevin's & Patryk's threads where they insinuate ( if not outright say ) that the jurisdictional issue is best determined at a later stage when the proverbial train has already left the station . I question whether these were serious points .::) If we analyze this closely ( & open to me misinterpreting your comments ) , it is to say that an uber tricky legal & political issue should be decided by the fact that resources & time has already been spent , so no good reason to stop now . What ? ! ?::) This issue should be decided by the letter of the law , not the expenditure of time , resources , and the like . If the Ct rejects jurisdiction & it is upheld on appeal , then so be it . We cannot manipulate ( diff from strategy ) the system to get the result we want / think it should be .::Notice here how Kip describes complying with the Rome Statute as manipulating the system . As Patryk and I both pointed out , the Rome Statute does * not * require the OTP to adjudicate jurisdiction at this point .::Major mischaracterization . Not saying it is a manipulation , but the reasons given for litigating later appear to be manipulation of the situation .::Not mischaractizing anything . You said that , diff [ erent ] from strategy , waiting until later to litigate jurisdiction would manipulate the system . Show me where the law says the OTP has to do it now .::Again , you conveniently leave out the reasons given to litigate later ( ie the train has left the station and that pressure will decide the matter ) . That is manipulating the system .::I see . So complying with the rules in a manner that maximises your chances of success is manipulating the system . And I m the one that doesn t understand the practitioner s perspective !::You have defined success here as only having one outcome . Maybe it could occur to you that the OTP is investigating the matter fairly and evenly , and don t want to do so if outside the Court s jurisdiction .::Yes , I have defined success as a practitioner would achieving one's litigation goal , which here is to investigate the Palestine situation . Your definition is fine if you re working for an NGO , but lawyers want to win - - and ethical ones want to win within the rules .::Again , define winning in terms of an INVESTIGATION , which this is . Yes , litigation of actual cases is where parties have clear goals of what is winning and losing . Not here .::Further , you cannot be arguing that OTP defines winning as investigating in a situation where jurisdiction is lacking . So I am clear : I am not saying they don t have jurisdiction .

figlang_twitter_4496,Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year s Eve !,". I ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is razor thin .::. In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that s just business as usual for Suleimani )::. More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .::. And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .::. But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .::. One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the far out option::. Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL>::. It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .::. According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : <URL>::. Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .::. But among the menu options that I had not heard before were : ( ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . <URL>::. Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias::. How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to for insight . He s studied Iraq since the s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :::. In , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US posture in Iraq::. It s all been downhill , told me , in terms of America s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces::. A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .::. Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one s trying to downplay Suleimani s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga .",NOT_SARCASM

figlang_twitter_4015,Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year s Eve !,". I ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is razor thin .::. In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that s just business as usual for Suleimani )::. More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .::. And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .::. But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .::. One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the far out option::. Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL>::. It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .::. According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : <URL>::. Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .::. But among the menu options that I had not heard before were : ( ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . <URL>::. Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias::. How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to for insight . He s studied Iraq since the s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :::. In , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US posture in Iraq::. It s all been downhill , told me , in terms of America s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces::. A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .::. Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one s trying to downplay Suleimani s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga .",NOT_SARCASM

And I m grateful for every source who entrusted his or her story and information to me . This was a team effort ! <URL>::I still don t get this . HBF was a subsidiary how ? According to who ? It had a diff board , no ? Also , why didn t anyone fight HBC on HBF donors behalf ? Instead Wisen , , et al took the pseudo-spiritual high road of silence on theft of donor funds <URL>::The HBF board was there only in theory , according to my sources . HBF was under the HBC elders who had no idea what was going on .::I m not trying to be difficult , but what does under the HBC board mean ? Are the sources saying that HBC s board was secretly the boss of HBF ? The sources use of subsidiary makes it sound like there was some kind of actual legal position of authority of one over the other::It wasn't secret . According to former HBF director , Gordon Zwirkoski , James very clearly articulated that he wanted HBF brought under HBC & the HBC elders . HBF allegedly ceased to be a separate c3 and became an auxiliary of HBC . At least , that's the narrative .::When does Mr Zwirkoski allege that happened ? What year ? Unless he says , financial statements , the IL SoS , and the IRS conflict w / his narrative , as far as I can tell . With these various "" open "" EINs , I have big concerns about theft & money laundering::He can t attest to it happening . In fact , he opposed it and that s why James fired him . No one seems to know for sure . My guess is only Fred Adams and James know and maybe Steve Huston . And maybe they kept separate orgs for the purpose you suggest .::knew . Seems pretty clear here . Also , HBF was renamed Vertical Church Network in Feb , per IL SoS , and uses the same EIN as HBF , it appears . <URL>::Yes , but the confusion was how it s a c3 but not a separate legal entity from HBC . Can t remember the term . Auxiliary something .::Integrated auxiliary . My current understanding is that if it were an integrated auxiliary , would have / should have noted it here . I can ask a NFP accounting expert .::Probe your NFP expert . I confess this is a new term for me .::See here <URL> Also , here's a screenshot from the final HBF audited statements by I see no lack of clarity here about what HBF was as a legal entity . If it was an IG of HBC , then why didn't CC say so ? <URL>::Moreover , HBF transitioned into VCN ( same EIN and IL corp file number ) . No one is asking if VCN is an integrated auxiliary of HBC , and no action was taken for it not to be . Why ? Because HBF wasn't a IA , in my opinion::If it wasn t an integrated auxiliary as Harvest leaders claimed , then HBC stole from HBF . If it is an IA , then what happened cannot be stealing because HBC & HBF we re legally the same .::Right . More importantly , it means HBC stole from HBF donors .

Even Wisen didn t know for sure whether HBF was an integrated auxiliary or not . I couldn t get a straight answer from Harvest about the board . Just a hot mess . GCC should ask for $ HBC owes .::I replied here . Seems to me that the entity relationships are made crystal-clear . I m also not seeing that HBC owes GCC anything . HBC owes donors to HBF , which may include $ given to HBF by the church plants . <URL> <URL>::Almost all of HBF's budget was from the independent Harvest churches that comprised HBF . When James disbanded HBF , those churches formed GCC . So I think GCC has a right to the $ . Or , the approx churches could seek reimbursement individually , but that would be vry complicated::GCC as an entity wouldn t have a right to that money , in my non-lawyerly opinion , b / c GCC didn t give the money & was formed ex post facto If the stolen money was directly from churches giving the % franchise fee to HBF , then the churches could perhaps band together & sue /",SARCASM

figlang_twitter_2223,i ve been physically assaulted coming out of the women s washroom by men for that very reason - their ridiculous fragile notion that we are somehow a threat .,"The fight over trans rights has ignored a key group : pro-trans feminists . Here , leading feminist thinkers told BuzzFeed News why feminism should include trans people . <URL>::One of the problems with biology , when discussing feminism and trans people , is where it leads , said Prof . Akwugo Emejulu . <URL>::This has always been the dark heart of white , feminist politics : a jealous guarding of the boundaries of who gets to be a woman , said Prof . Emejulu She cited several examples of white feminists excluding women from ethnic minorities , but began with the earliest . <URL>::This continues to the present day , she said . Boundary making is what s crucial here . Therefore , she said , excluding trans people is a way of keeping one s position or status . <URL>::Keeping trans women out is , Prof . Sally Hines said , regulating who can belong to a category in order to close down membership , in order to protect the rights of a dominant majority [ white women ] .::Prof . Emejulu & Prof . Vanita Sundaram argue that for feminism to really deliver equality & emancipation , it must also focus on problems women face as a result of oppression on basis of factors other than their sex : in particular race , class , sexuality , disability , & gender identity . <URL>::Prof . Sundaram : My own research area is violence vs women & girls , and we know that trans women are more vulnerable to violence , harassment , and everyday abuse than other groups of women . So as a feminist and academic , it s my responsibility to advocate for that group of women .::So it has to be a feminism that challenges patriarchy and other systems of hierarchy that are used to oppress , gender identity being one of them , Prof . Sundaram . <URL>::One of the reasons that a war over trans rights has raged more intensely among feminists in the U . K . than in the US , said Prof . Alison Phipps , is the blame has been put on to the wrong group , and trans people are carrying the can for problems that are not of their making . <URL>::The idea that simplifying trans women s legal recognition would lead to increase in attacks in toilets or prisons was unfounded . Prof . Phipps said evidence doesn t show trans women to be anything like as sexually violent as men ... while instead being even more likely to be victims <URL>::Painting trans women as predators when they are routinely victims is unjust . And because perceived threat is not the same as actual threat , policies should be based on actual levels of risk , which are low , Prof Phipps .",SARCASM

figlang_twitter_2375,I'm sure your choice to post a gif from the movie that defines your life had nothing to do with your INABILITY to explain how a single failure in a system is justification for discarding the whole system .,"While I'm glad a good guy with a gun stopped him from slaughtering that congregation , two men whose lives mattered were slaughtered because the bad guy had a gun to begin with . Guns are a problem .::Two points : ) You can't eliminate guns . ) The killer can kill without a gun ( Arson , vehicular homicide , and many more ways to do so ) , but it's a lot harder to stop them without one .::Right . And men with guns stopped him . If you take away all the guns from the scenario , he could use another weapon to kill people , but the people would have no effective means to fight back .::So a knife has a faster kill rate than an AR or shotgun ? I'd rather take my chances against the knife . This old trope of an argument is spoon fed NRA garbage .::No , but a vehicle does . And what's the best way to stop a madman with a vehicle ? That's right , a gun . What you're saying is that you'd rather be disarmed completely , and hope killers use ineffective ways to kill people , than have the opportunity to defend yourself effectively .::I'm saying that the argument of gun control leaves guns with criminals , or they will kill somehow anyway so may as well be a gun , are tired overused propaganda from the NRA . No one is going to take all the guns . Believing they'll try is idiotic . Common sense control is a must .::But every proposal affects only the law-abiding , and does next to nothing to stop criminals . Universal background checks ? Long waiting periods ? Criminals can still steal guns or buy them on the black market . "" Assault weapon "" bans ? Ineffective at saving lives . What's your idea ?::And what we're doing now is saving lives and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals ? ?::Yes , violent crime is trending downwards . But I agree that more should be done to stop dangerous people . Widespread education on safe storage of firearms and the importance of theft prevention would be helpful . But people don't want gun education in schools .::We could allow the general public to access the NICS background check system so they can verify who they're selling a gun to without paying a gun dealer to run the check for them . But nobody has proposed that .::It depends on the dealer . Around me , it's usually around $ -30 . Add in the time and hassle of butter and seller finding a gun store that's open at a time convenient to both , and an unfortunate number of people might just say "" Eh , I'm sure you're fine "" and selling the gun .::Then it would be an illegal sale if % background checks become law .::It's an illegal sale anyways , because it's illegal for a criminal to buy guns . That's why they steal them ( which is illegal ) , or use straw purchasers ( which is also illegal ) . You could pass % background check laws , but it will only affect people who obey the law anyway .::It would flag people with mental health issues , domestic violence arrests , etc . <URL>::It could , but it could fail , too . Especially when people just don't obey the law . That's why I prefer giving people other than gun dealers access to NICS checks . It's not a burden on the law-abiding , but it will give them the ability to avoid selling to anyone who is prohibited .::The Aurora , Illinois shooter was a prohibited possessor , yet he was abled to buy a gun at a store because NICS failed . Also , the vast majority of criminals obtained their guns through theft or the black market .::Last night my wife's car failed to start and she called be for help . I told her that if it failed once , then it's useless . Don't try and fix it . Don't even buy another one , because if one car fails then all cars are worthless , or at least I WOULD HAVE said that if I were INSANE .",SARCASM

Your debating skills amaze me .","So I was reading this thread on the EI forum ( I m not proud of myself I was bored ) . Anyway this so called punter / white knight / possibly another escort was pissed because this escort called Rafaella got a star review . Not a bad review as stars is the maximum number of stars that::can be given . So he proceeded to slam the reviewer who is a good , honest reviewer a thing which is in short supply these days , especially on a site like Escort Ireland which is renowned for fake reviews . Anyway the usual suspect saps and irate escort alcoholic Nikita UK::proceeded to attack this reviewer and other posters who spoke out in his defence . As the night went and started getting into the wee small hours ( well after am ) the posts from the white knights and Nikita started getting more abusive , irate and ludicrous . One post in particular::by a poster called funboy had me in snorting out loud with laughter at his logic for giving a bad review . Surely this sap cant be serious . According to him a bad review should only be allowed after visiting the escort more than once , ermmm no I don t think so , a bad review::can be left after the st visit . A bad review after the rd visit would have me thinking does this reviewer have a grudge , the st reviews sung her praises , a rd review that s bad would stink of revenge to me either because the client is pushy , abusive or stalkerish and the::escort doesn t want to see that client again .

But it needs saying . We've just lived through a period in which many charged with protecting British Jews have done the exact opposite . I'm referring here especially to the Chief Rabbi , Board of Deputies and Jewish Chronicle .::Completely in the face of the evidence , a narrative was created by the media , and doubled down on by those I mention above . This narrative blamed those who can always be found on the front line fighting AGAINST all forms of racism for antisemitism .::At the same time , as antisemitism on the right and far right rose , rose and rose some more , the response was ... nothing . Nothing whatsoever . The organisations and individuals I've referred to above simply DO NOT CARE about most Jews . That's what their record shows .::And as they do not care about most Jews , the following is likely to happen : . Any attacks such as the latest awful ones will be blamed on the left , regardless of reality . . This will cause ever more panic among British Jews .::. If any left wing Jews are attacked , heaven help them . Because as their record proves , those whose responsibility it is to protect them will do not the slightest thing . . Antisemitism will continue to rise from the far right : whose existence is being normalised .::Don't expect the individuals and organisations I mentioned in the OP to magically come to their senses . THEY DON'T CARE . Least of all about anyone poor , disabled , vulnerable , or left wing .::Already , we've seen an online campaign to somehow blame these latest atrocities on the left . Already , we are seeing absurd , revolting attempts to paint Bernie Sanders as an antisemite . This will only get worse . The only cure is education and solidarity .::When Michael Rosen - MICHAEL ROSEN ! ! - is persistently attacked and smeared for the crime of caring with all his heart for all his fellow Jews ( and for humanity itself ) , what's going on here couldn't be clearer . Not least when the person insulting him is followed by blue ticks .::The past years or so have seen the most hysterical , disgusting campaign of smears and lies I have ever known in British politics or British public life . That's not going to magically stop now . Facts no longer matter . Evidence no longer matters .::Those responsible for this are interested only in the following : . Attention ( in the case of celebrities ) . Clicks and newspaper sales ( in the case of the Jewish Chronicle ) . The defeat of the left::None of them are remotely interested in the defeat of antisemitism . They couldn't be less so . And you know how I know that ? Because Britain has a prime minister who personally profited from antisemitism for YEARS ... and these organisations rejoiced in his victory .::The House of Commons , meanwhile , has a leader who has repeatedly propagated horrendous antisemitic tropes ; as has the prime minister's special adviser . Again : none of them say a single damn word .::The Jewish Chronicle has been referred by IPSO for sanctions due to its false , evidence-free demonisation of a Labour activist , after an investigation with which it refused to cooperate . This is far from the first time it's been in trouble either .::And the Chief Rabbi himself makes an outrageous intervention into an election campaign to inquire about Britain's ' moral compass ' ... while the poor get poorer , disabled people take their own lives , and austerity claims hundreds of thousands of victims . Under the party he backs .::Sam Kriss refers to all of this as the war against the Jews . He's right . And what he had to say should be read by all . <URL>::But as Sam Kriss is a left wing Jew , for these people and these organisations , he's therefore the wrong kind of Jew . Or even , a non-Jew . Because goodness knows , voices like his , Rosen's or so many others must at all costs be drowned out by nonsense and hysteria .::Down this road lies absolute catastrophe . When so-called civilised societies abandon evidence , abandon reason , abandon any sense whatsoever of community , solidarity or the ties which bind us all , catastrophe is always what results .::And when it does , those responsible for this disgusting campaign will , I'm sure , continue to blame the left ... even as the left does everything in its power to help .
