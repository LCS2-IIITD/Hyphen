Im sure rollout will become stratified but the aim is to vaccinate as many as poss with avail supplies. Risk of long covid is reportedly higher so if its Vaxzevria or nothing Id take my chances. Those I refer to are mainly in age groups where benefit/risk ratio is much higher!,"# ::snt Im sure rollout will become stratified but the aim is to vaccinate as many as poss with avail supplies.
