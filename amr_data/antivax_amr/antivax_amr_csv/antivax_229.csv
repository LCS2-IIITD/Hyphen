They r partially tested hence claims t b % 'effective' in limited &amp; specific way f about yr with unknown long term effects. mRNA is more gene 'therapy' than vaccine. Even Gates admits they're 'experimental' bt alleges risk/benefit analysis justifies it!,"# ::snt They r partially tested hence claims t b % 'effective' in limited &amp; specific way f about yr with unknown long term effects. mRNA is more gene 'therapy' than vaccine.
