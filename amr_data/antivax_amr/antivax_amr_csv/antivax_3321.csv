It's really heartening me to see people being vaccinated at home. The hesitancy has been hard to watch. During the pandemic my folks have both had major health scares and have gone into care so it would be great for it to be safe to come home again one day x Congratulations!,"# ::snt It's really heartening me to see people being vaccinated at home.

Good work I too joined the group of Australians this week who have had their first vaccination. I still talk to people where I live that wont get vaccinated unfortunately. And prefer not to talk about their choice despite knowing Karl and how bad COVID can be.,"# ::snt Good work I too joined the group of Australians this week who have had their first vaccination.
