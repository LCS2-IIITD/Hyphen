hours post vaccination and time for my first surgery check in: feel totally fine! Good actually! I took a Tylenol and iced my arm right after for about -10 minutes and I dont feel any side effects. Normally my arm will be sore for days after flu shot but feels fine!,"# ::snt hours post vaccination and time for my first surgery check in: feel totally fine! Good actually!
