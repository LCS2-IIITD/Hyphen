"Pfizer is a mRNA vaccine unlike Adenovirus type vaccines like Sputnik V. mRNA vaccines alters your DNA, while Adenovirus or vaccines with a deactivated virus does not. Since mRNA vaccines are not a vaccine by definition, it's gene therapy. I'd gladly take Sputnik V.","# ::snt Pfizer is a mRNA vaccine unlike Adenovirus type vaccines like Sputnik V. mRNA vaccines alters your DNA, while Adenovirus or vaccines with a deactivated virus does not.
