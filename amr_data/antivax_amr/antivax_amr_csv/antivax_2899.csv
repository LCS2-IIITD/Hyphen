Hopefully you're feeling better now. Said usually people feel worse after the second one.Asked if my wife &amp; I could switch out bc we didn't want to bring the kids inside bc the baby can't wear a mask. Ended up coming outside to give it to me. I'm so appreciative they did that!,"# ::snt Hopefully you're feeling better now.
