Indeed. Your point is ? Are you suggesting vaccinations solved polio &amp; measles ? So that's the logic for mass vax for Covid ? Few actually had polio vaccines btw63 but not that age is relevant to the debate.,"# ::snt Indeed. Your point is ? Are you suggesting vaccinations solved polio &amp; measles ?

That's the theory but end result could be very different. Human immune system for healthy is c. % efficient whilst the vax is in % region.Odds for unhealthy people are much lower.
