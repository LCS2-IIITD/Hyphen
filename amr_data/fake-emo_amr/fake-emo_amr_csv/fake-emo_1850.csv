@ChuckCallesto Let us think this out. @CNN believes people still think a woman should have a voice. Jim is upset because a woman didn't say what he (a man) wanted her to say. Sounds to me like he wants to keep his toxic masculinity there to make a woman do what he wants. Damn White Privilege. https://t.co/d8hT318Soq,"# ::snt @ChuckCallesto Let us think this out. @CNN believes people still think a woman should have a voice.
