"@Rashad1380 @realDonaldTrump @WAOK @V103Atlanta That was meant to be an intelligent interview. MrJones came to the station with a plan to do exactly what he did he had no plans to stay for the entire interview Mr. Jones knew he could not stand up to facts and truth. That is why he hid. Likely paid by T.
