@PARISDENNARD It's possible. Lincoln got away with jailing anti war politicians (politicians were wrong). Trump had never used his executive power to that extent and is treated FAR less kindly. It could also be because our generation just has a bunch of rude people. Less so then.,"# ::snt @PARISDENNARD It's possible.
