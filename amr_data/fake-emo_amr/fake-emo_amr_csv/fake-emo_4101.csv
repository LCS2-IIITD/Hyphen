"@MjfScarf @CodyRhodes I tried, but I liked it when it was an hour and on the network. More and more though, regular programming and those god awful ppv's made me so sick that 10 dollars a month wasn't worth it. AEW gave use something different and the roster isn't buried in 30 seconds every week.","# ::snt @MjfScarf @CodyRhodes I tried, but I liked it when it was an hour and on the network.
