"No one is going to be tuning in to the G-League. They could bring Pistol Pete, Spud Webb, Manute Bol, Dennis Rodman, Muggsy Bogues for a starting 5 and no one would tune in. They average 2,000 a game and that’s not going to change regardless of who they bring in. Straight Talk","# ::snt No one is going to be tuning in to the G-League.
