🙏🏻 @sainsburys We’re on the verge of Leaving you forever. Keep your staff & shoppers safe.  Supermarkets are extremely DANGEROUS places. We saw a lady in 80’s in @sainsburys crying this week because of the danger. Tell staff to remove shoppers coughing more than 2 minutes.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,"# ::snt 🙏🏻 @sainsburys We’re on the verge of Leaving you forever. Keep your staff & shoppers safe.
