@larryelder @CNN Again a perfect example of what the left will do to sell their ideas. When Sanders a Socialist goes to Mt Rushmore and talks about history in grand terms it’s great. Obama went and they fawned on him. Trump goes and he’s a racist because of who is carved on the mountain. Sad BS.,"# ::snt @larryelder @CNN Again a perfect example of what the left will do to sell their ideas. When Sanders a Socialist goes to Mt Rushmore and talks about history in grand terms it’s great.
