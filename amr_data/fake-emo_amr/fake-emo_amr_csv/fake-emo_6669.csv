"@RealKellyJones @realDonaldTrump You have no idea what fascism is. First, learn the meaning of fascism and compare it with the US. Concerning the press, have a look at CNN's Youtube and Twitter channel.  There you will definitely find 90% anti Trump videos and postings. No matter what happens, Trump is to blame. https://t.co/JRPgMvcyu4","# ::snt @RealKellyJones @realDonaldTrump You have no idea what fascism is.
