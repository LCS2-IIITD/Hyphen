@TrumpWarRoom Hi. Which trump son is Fredo? It's so hard to tell and sometimes it's like the name switches back and forth between the two from Tweet to Tweet. Is there a Pandemic Playbook like book or manual for identifying which one is Fredo I can order? Thanks in advance. Bye.,"# ::snt @TrumpWarRoom Hi. Which trump son is Fredo?
