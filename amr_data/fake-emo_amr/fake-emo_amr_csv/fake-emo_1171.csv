@peterswitzer Sorry. This tweet is ignorant. WHO stats ex. China show a &gt;15% mortality rate without medical care (prior to EOM January). Mortality rate with western medical care (assuming we can inhibit spread) is 5x seasonal influenza - which btw kills a portion of healthy individuals. https://t.co/4T7osHLioT,"# ::snt @peterswitzer Sorry.
