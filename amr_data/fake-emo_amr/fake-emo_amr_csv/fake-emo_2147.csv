"INCORRECT.

The treason is created by conspirators (domestic or foreign) attacking the 'United States'. 

The 'United States' includes attacks on the Constitution, (eg office of the Presidency and the Congress).

The acts must be overt and beyond mere seditious conspiracy. https://t.co/dFypE6PmoJ","# ::snt INCORRECT.
