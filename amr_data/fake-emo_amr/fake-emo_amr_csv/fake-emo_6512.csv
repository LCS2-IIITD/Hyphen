@ValleyFloydFred Haha need to read that article very carefully. It is only if the clubs appeal the sanctions given to them next week as they donâ€™t think the EFL will get it done by mid-August deadline. Wigan is already on appeal so is not something that can be appealed again so final decision.,"# ::snt @ValleyFloydFred Haha need to read that article very carefully.
