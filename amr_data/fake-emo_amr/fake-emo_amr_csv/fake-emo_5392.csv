@DanCovfefe1 @andweknow Has anyone else thought about making a Deep State Fantasy game? Kind of like Fantasy Football. We choose our favorite teams of Deep staters??? Maybe a board game? Killary can be an Ogre card?  Troll cards. Troubled Fisa card lose a turn. Get the idea? https://t.co/lGNSout4Gd,"# ::snt @DanCovfefe1 @andweknow Has anyone else thought about making a Deep State Fantasy game? Kind of like Fantasy Football.
