"@BugibbaWeather @WeasleWords @BBCBreaking Hi Bugibba, I’m just scrolling through and I’ve noticed a couple of your replies. I’m not sure how to break this, so I’ll be blunt - you aren’t as funny as you think. To be honest, you aren’t actually funny at all. Maybe try for quality over quantity in future.","# ::snt @BugibbaWeather @WeasleWords @BBCBreaking Hi Bugibba, I’m just scrolling through and I’ve noticed a couple of your replies.
