"What Judge Sullivan, a man with a great reputation, did yesterday is inexcusable. 

From the bench he accused Gen. Flynn of heinous crimes of which Flynn is innocent and was never charged. His subsequent mea culpa is irrelevant. 

Flynn should be pardoned and Mueller fired today.","# ::snt What Judge Sullivan, a man with a great reputation, did yesterday is inexcusable.
