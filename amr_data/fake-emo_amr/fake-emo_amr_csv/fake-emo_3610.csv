@LyleStewart55 @WBrettWilson @DavidSuzukiFDN @leadnowca @cathmckenna Is it balanced to deny all pipelines and let others produce the energy at lower standards? Balanced to deny pipelines to East Canada to instead import energy by tankers from Mid East? Brett is not a deny:er. He is realistic. Denying pipe is not a solution.,"# ::snt @LyleStewart55 @WBrettWilson @DavidSuzukiFDN @leadnowca @cathmckenna Is it balanced to deny all pipelines and let others produce the energy at lower standards?
