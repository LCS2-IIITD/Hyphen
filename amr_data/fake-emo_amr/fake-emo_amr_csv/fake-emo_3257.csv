Hey @pulte 👋🏼 hope you are having a great day. Thanks for helping lot of people out. Me and my parents could use your help. We were behind on rent and bills and our stimulus $ is pretty much gone after that. Parents are laid off. 🙏🏼🙏🏼 💥 💥 $Danhusky93 #BailoutHumans,"# ::snt Hey @pulte 👋🏼 hope you are having a great day.
