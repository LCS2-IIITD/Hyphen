I agree with her. I don't believe she is a racist. I think she is out of touch. Trying to portray her as racist hurts US because now people will try to group real racist acts as playing the race card. Having roaches is not a black thing but it is a nasty thing.,"# ::snt I agree with her. I don't believe she is a racist. I think she is out of touch.
