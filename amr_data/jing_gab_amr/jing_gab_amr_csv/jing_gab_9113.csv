"They call women ""feminists"" but then sit there pontificating on their sexual preferences in women OPENLY in MIXED COMPANY. I never see women doing this. ""Okay here's my list of things I find hot on a man"" - is a conversation I have in private with my girlfriends. The right wing is fucked. And this is the LEAST of the retarded bullshit that was ONCE considered ""locker room talk"" that the bottom feeders in the Dolt Right just verbally vomit on social media. Go back to being liberals. You sure act like people with zero standards of behavior whatsoever.","# ::snt They call women ""feminists"" but then sit there pontificating on their sexual preferences in women OPENLY in MIXED COMPANY.
