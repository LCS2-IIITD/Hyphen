"Just did a full analysis of Christine B. Ford's statements in the Kavanaugh hearings... I took a stenographer's transcript, eliminated everything not Ford talking, and performed a full analysis... There are a whopping points of interest in her statement (of words) where words were substituted, out of tense, improper pronouns (a lot of ""we"" in there), unnecessarily renaming things (car/vehicle, restroom/bathroom) in the same statements indicative to change in perception about the object names. There were ""but"" turnarounds where the aft-but statement contradicts the fore-but statement (BUT = Behold the Underlying Truth - usually what comes after is the most important part of the statement). There are loads of words like""because"" ""cause"" ""so"" ""since""""started"" ""began"" ""continued"" and ""proceeded"" which all indicate perceived ideas of cause or pause. These are often riddled throughout made up stories, especially concerning rape. A rape victim can never know why a rapist rapes, nor will she lend pause to the crime of rape.Cause and pause lend to the ideas of foreknowledge of the ""event"" - another word she swapped out for assault a few times - something no true rape victim has, foreknowledge a rape will occur. There are a multitude of ""believe"" ""believed"" ""assumed"" ""think"" ""thought"" ""guess"" ""guessed"" ""surmise"" and ""surmised"" statements (which show internal illustration or lack of certainty). Then several ""house"" and ""home"" statements - she claims that she doesn't remember if it was a ""residential home or country club,"" but her words deceived her times in the testimony where she called it not only a house, but also a home, which is a term of endearment made about a place we feel safe at. She probably spent more time at that place than with her parents, as she even stated ""went back to my parent's house,"" after. She refers to Kavanaugh as ""a kid"" in a ""group of kids"" and ""a boy/the boy,"" times. Words like ""kid"" ""kids"" ""boy"" ""girl"" ""children"" show that they were never formally introduced and likely didn't know one another well at all. She even states ""since that incident, until July , I never even spoken the name Brett Kavanaugh."" She also contradicts herself a multitude of times with how things went down and how she escaped, just from one paragraph to the next. She states she escaped, but also states they stumbled away down the hall as she went across the hall into a bathroom, then casually walked out the front door. The bathroom is interesting as she called it a restroom before (""I asked if I could use the restroom,"" ""I went into the restroom,"" ""when I came out of the restroom"") then consistently a bathroom after, as in something inside changed her view of it, like cleaning up after. Also, people that have done something wrong often include bathrooms in their narratives, as it is often a way to express that they came out clean after. When you are discussing a sexual allegation it is a detail that seems out of place. Usually the rapist or sexual aggressor will be the one that mentions the bathroom, not a victim. She doesn't even remember if it was Kavanaugh that pushed her into the bedroom, or if it was Mike Judge. She also keeps mentioning a P.J. that was there, but no context as to why she mentions him, only that he was ""tall and a nice boy."" She speaks passionately and inclusively about Judge yet dismissively about Kavanaugh. In the same way you would about that kid that sat behind you in Chemistry that seemingly remembers you, but you can't remember him. Flat out, %, this chick is lying beyond the normal meaning of the word.","# ::snt Just did a full analysis of Christine B. Ford's statements in the Kavanaugh hearings...

"I don't think so, because this isn't an actual circuit court trial, although they are treating it that way... It's weird... I think they should. I also think they need to start taking rape allegations more seriously and the accuser needs to have repercussions. If I falsely accuse you of murder and I get busted lying, I'll go to jail. If I accuse you of rape, and it's found I'm lying, it's like I get an uncomfortable laugh and told not to do it again... The allegation of rape needs to be taken much more seriously, both ways, and it needs to stop being a media circus.

It's weird... I think they should. I also think they need to start taking rape allegations more seriously and the accuser needs to have repercussions. If I falsely accuse you of murder and I get busted lying, I'll go to jail. If I accuse you of rape, and it's found I'm lying, it's like I get an uncomfortable laugh and told not to do it again... The allegation of rape needs to be taken much more seriously, both ways, and it needs to stop being a media circus. Even when they say, Kavanaugh didn't do it -- his home life is still ruined.
