">The testimonyIS theevidence. >You may still be innocent, but you still don't ""deserve"" a Supreme Court seat. believe this. There's just... there's so much wrong here. I've rarely seen anything so spectacularly wrongheaded laid out so plainly, by someone with no awareness. We need to start teaching real civics and real American history in school again (and not this guilt-ridden, Marxist, ""Oh, white men are evil colonizers"" BS). These mush-brained morons shouldn't be allowed to vote as is, if this is the tripe their minds are producing. Testimonies ARE NEVERconsidered evidence in and of themselves. EVIDENCE is evidence.

You get Joseph locked in prison for years, for rejecting Potiphar's wife's advances. You getlynch mobs and To Kill a Mockingbird. , my foot. You don't suddenly get to avoid questioning and cross examination simply because you're the owner of a vagina. BTW, this moron's tag is on twitter, if you want to counter this cancerous idiocy before it spreads further. I'd do it myself, but my tweets were too powerful for Twitter to contain - reaching literally millions at any given time - so naturally they banned me months ago.","# ::snt >The testimonyIS theevidence. >You may still be innocent, but you still don't ""deserve"" a Supreme Court seat. believe this.
