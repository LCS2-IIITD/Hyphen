"Isn't it obvious that non-violent protests don't work? The only reason the EDL were able to put the Muslim rape gangs on the national agenda was because in the first two years that EDL existed (2009-2010), multiple demonstrations descended into riots (Stoke, Manchester, Dudley). It was the fear of the elite that a movement of thousands of hard menwas growing, men who would smash up towns and smash up the police. That fear meant that the police decided to end their years of facilitating the rape gangs. If the EDL had not been a violent threat, then there'd still be no prosecutions of those rape gangs. The Muslim Council of Britain (representing mosques) would still say ""it's a racist myth"", as they were saying in . The BNP tried the civilised route (political meetings, pamphlets, manifestos) to try and draw attention to the rape gangs. It achieved nothing. If Britain was a democracy instead of an oligarchy, the BNP might have been able to bring about change through the ballot box. Muslims keep winning because they are prepared to kill and be killed. The IRA are on the verge of getting a united Ireland, simply because people fear a return of terrorism from them. In the same way, Britain will continue to cede ground to Muslims. As Pompei the Great said: ""don't quote your laws at us, we have swords"".","# ::snt Isn't it obvious that non-violent protests don't work?
