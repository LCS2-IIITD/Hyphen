"I feel I must mention Tommy Robinson this morning. yrs ago I took to using my access to the armed forces bases around the UK in order to try to influence them regarding certain Nazi tropes, well disguised but not buried. I wrote about it on here from time to time. It is good to see Tommy Robinson doing something similar now, the interesting thing is that he is NOT pushing the jew narrative, everything he says is compatible with my own views regarding the jew. This must be of quite some concern to his financiers. The biggest lie told to Reserves (being readied right now for deployment in !) is that Russia is the target. Tommy is like me trying to make the forces realise that Russia is NOT the enemy and our foe emanates from the Middle East. He still is not an open antisemite but he is helping that cause hugely. So I have to give Tommy Robinson a big up for his efforts of late. Well done Tommy Robinson!","# ::snt I feel I must mention Tommy Robinson this morning. yrs ago I took to using my access to the armed forces bases around the UK in order to try to influence them regarding certain Nazi tropes, well disguised but not buried.
