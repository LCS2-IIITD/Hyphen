"For starters, these people compose an invading force. There will be armed men somewhere in the background who owe their allegiance to some non-American group probably funded by Soros. I think Trump understands that to meet and stop these people will require a company or larger size military force. They will have to be experienced and armed with some non-lethal weapons, possibly something like sound emitting devices that cause some type of temporary paralysis via naseau or disorientation. However, the quickes way to stop them is tell Mexico NO MORE MONEY and the recent trade deal is off.","# ::snt For starters, these people compose an invading force.

Under the law 'migrants' trying to cross our border are not an 'invading force'. The legal definition of that is limited to military or terrorist forces attacking our country. It will be interesting to see just how Trump uses our military without running afoul of Posse Comatatus.,"# ::snt Under the law 'migrants' trying to cross our border are not an 'invading force'.
