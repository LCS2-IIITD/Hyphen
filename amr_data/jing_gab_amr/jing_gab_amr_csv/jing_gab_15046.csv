"Here is the article by Greg Johnson. Read it and decide for yourself. I agree with some of it, some of it is objectionable. The part about heilgate smacks of ill-will. One can place some blame on Richard Spencer for the seig heiling debacle at NPI, but to not even mention who actually did the heiling when that person is known personally to Greg Johnson is absurd. You can blame Spencer for inviting that individual, but Spencer didn't know that Enoch was going to organize heiling at the NPI event. Who am I talking about? Mike Enoch of course. Greg knows that Mike Enoch did the heiling, and still supported Enoch long after the event. How can you have a problem with Spencer and not with Enoch for the exact same incident? The answer is that you can't and the incident at NPI is being used battering ram against Spencer. The amnesnia in the rank and file about Mike Enoch's role in the NPI heiling incident is one of the queerer things about the alt-right. Proof that Greg Johnson supported Mike Enoch after heilgate below. Of course you can go around saying ""don't purge"" and then write polemics that if successful will have the exact effect of purging.","# ::snt Here is the article by Greg Johnson.

"Here is the problem with Heilgate as I see it: There is a time and a place for everything.

The swastika flag guy that mysteriously marched in Charlottesville would have been the cherry on top had he appeared at NPI. Who was Mike Enoch to make the decision to do that? If Richard Spencer wanted to do that he could, it being his event. As it is Mike Enoch did it and got none of the blame. In fact on the TRS forum they allowed attacks on Richard Spencer for what happened at NPI and banned anyone that mentioned Mike Enoch's pivotal role in it. Whether one finds Roman saluting aesthetically pleasing or not is irrelevant. If there was proper discipline, it never would have happened.
