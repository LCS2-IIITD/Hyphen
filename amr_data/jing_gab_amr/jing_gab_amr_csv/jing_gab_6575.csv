"That word ""leftist national socialist"" alone ... However, I'm not really blaming you because your post just reflects one of the biggest problems of our time: that we've become so brainwashed and degenerate that we're resorting to virtue signalling and mindless attacks on perceived `enemies` instead of thinking for ourselves. You obviously have no idea what National Socialism was really about - but that's no surprise considering how hard the establishment pushed to prevent you from finding this very truth. But you are right on one important issue - you cannot blame an entire group for the actions of individuals (who may not even be part of that group). I suppose you're talking about that ""Boomer Bomber"" - there have been some great discussions about this recently, for instance both on Red Ice and on JF's show with Dr. David Duke this Friday.","# ::snt That word ""leftist national socialist"" alone ...
