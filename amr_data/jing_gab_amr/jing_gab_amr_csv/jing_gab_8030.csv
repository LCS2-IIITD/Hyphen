Not able to connect with others, so rage is their friend because of the mentality. They were made by the CIA multi-national globalists to be this way. They use to hidden away and now they are being sent out like in the movie Willard. A social misfit uses his only friends, his pet rats, to exact revenge on his tormentors","# ::snt Kinda like pulling a pacifier out of the mouth of a five year old child when they want it.
