I am going to bet that our boy obliterates them this evening... Lol my money is totally on Tucker here. He obviously got under their skin with last week's segments on them not being able to sleep well while igniting the fire of violence on the left... I think it's even more hilarious that they didn't even come up with anything unique to poke fun at... Where as Tucker sure will. Lol Scott Adams likes to point out 'sour' Don Lemon ironic name & we have to wonder if Cuomo would have his own show if he wasn't the little brother of the current Governor and son of a former one?,"# ::snt I am going to bet that our boy obliterates them this evening...
