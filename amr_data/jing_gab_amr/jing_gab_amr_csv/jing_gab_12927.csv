I notice some people on Gab post the sort of messages that are obviously intended to discredit everyone else here. Are these leftists who do this on purpose? Because leftists do that a lot when they pose as right-wingers and post offensive shit on social media and then scream how nasty the right are. i mute these scum at once. You should do the same.,"# ::snt I notice some people on Gab post the sort of messages that are obviously intended to discredit everyone else here. Are these leftists who do this on purpose?
