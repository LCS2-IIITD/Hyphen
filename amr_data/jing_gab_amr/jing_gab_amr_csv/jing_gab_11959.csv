"They grounded and pounded , stomping on his head. They split the arm open of a bystander that tried to stop the ground and pound. They punched me in the right side of my head a bunch of times when I pulled them all off from Mark, the camera guy. I was able to pull them off from him, but the right side of my head took a beating while providing the cover Mark needed to get the streaming device to safety. I was taking blows the whole time, and there was a whole pack of them. It was one blow to the head after another the whole time, struggling to stay standing, and NOT HITTING BACK, because a bunch of them were filming the event trying to get footage of ME HITTING BACK so they could isolate the footage and use it to throw me in solitary confinement, like they did to They would have probably killed us if they had been able to capture the streaming device. Watch the video, Mark was able to retreat to safety while I continued to take blows against the whole gang of them. My vest was shredded and the buttons on my suit were hanging by a thread.

"I'm ashamed to say this, but I watched that show on Netflix with the girl from the Brady Bunch who became undead and they had to eat people. There was one episode where they met some Nazis and it was just perfectly okay for them to kill and eat them. It's in their skulls that it's okay to kill Nazis. Hollywood made it that way.","# ::snt I'm ashamed to say this, but I watched that show on Netflix with the girl from the Brady Bunch who became undead and they had to eat people.
