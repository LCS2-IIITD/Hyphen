Europe is suffering from the effect of extremely unwise immigration policies. Soros had a hand in that. Is Soros suffering because of his globalist views? No. Soros has a hand in funding the caravan of people headed to illegally invade the U.S. They will have no funding to return to their home when turned away.Will Soros care? No. Thank God Trump is in office.,"# ::snt Europe is suffering from the effect of extremely unwise immigration policies. Soros had a hand in that. Is Soros suffering because of his globalist views?
