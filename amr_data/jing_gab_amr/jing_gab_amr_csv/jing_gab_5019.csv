"OH DEAR GOD>....... Obama Quickly Takes Credit For Pastor Andrew Brunson's Release From Turkey...................... (enjoy the satire) Look, when was Brunson first arrested? October , thats right. The man gets arrested during my administration and now Republicans want to give Trump credit for his release, just because he applied crippling pressure to Erdogan until the deed was done? Please! he added. The former president went on to explain how nobody has a better track record of caring for Christians than he does, and no other president before or since him has commanded such fear and respect on the world stage. President Trump, you didnt do that. Obama did that, he said. Youre welcome. SMFH..........","# ::snt OH DEAR GOD>.......
