"% of this invading army is fighting aged men. If they shield themselves with their women and children, that's on them. You didn't answer my question. Would you vote democrat if a bunch of rednecks blew away an invading force while live on tv? Okay, count you out of the shooting part, but would you vote Kamala for President? The media is going to paint the worst picture imaginable regardless of what actually happens. Babies ripped from their mother's arms and Trump is a racist. You trying to cater to ""live tv"" only helps them and gets you no appeasement points, at all. Let me also ask you, if the border was Israeli and these were Pals, would it be different?","# ::snt % of this invading army is fighting aged men.
