"DIEversity, one more mind fucked kid ruined for life, ""another happy customer served"". What does it say when a victim of the truly evil actually feels ""empowered"" instead of used? If the powerful, unnamed, deep pocketed interests in this world wanted Americans to be male or female, physically fit, informed, & educated well beyond what public schools offer, and it served their financial interests for our people to be thus, where would that leave all the people who spring up to take an ""identity"" when it gets created out of thin air by dirty moneyed facilitators of the powerful? I would weep for such broken people, but my heart filled up long ago. You are a means to their end Aaron Philip, you are the hood ornament to their demented perverse thinking. A headlight that illuminates their dark path, a proof that their insanity is made manifest. You poor child.","# ::snt DIEversity, one more mind fucked kid ruined for life, ""another happy customer served"".
