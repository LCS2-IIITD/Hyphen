"Someone here on Gab--can't remember who--told me that Trump very deliberately punctured John McCain's legend, leaving McCain powerless to stop the Republicans from reinventing their party and making it what it should always have been. Lindsey Graham admitted as much. He told Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, ""When they write the history of the Senate, John will be in the first paragraph."" To me, the past is the past. McCain is dead. He is an ex-senator. All I care about is the present and the future. Both Graham and Susan Collins are SHINING. That tells me that McCain was far more malevolent than we knew. I have no doubt that he used whatever means necessary to keep the Republicans from actually helping us. Bitter, angry, hate-filled people must always inflict suffering. Always. Trump demolished McCain, and then McCain died. And now we see our senators being the people we'd always hoped they would be.","# ::snt Someone here on Gab--can't remember who--told me that Trump very deliberately punctured John McCain's legend, leaving McCain powerless to stop the Republicans from reinventing their party and making it what it should always have been.
