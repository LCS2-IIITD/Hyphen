"TRUMP DOES IT AGAIN. ""The high-profile Vietnamese dissident and writer known as Mother Mushroom has arrived in the US with her children and mother after being released from jail. ""Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh left Vietnam on Wednesday to fly to Houston, Texas, immediately after her early morning release. ""News that Ms Quynh had been released on Wednesday emerged soon after US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis left Vietnam after a short visit. It is unclear if he pressed for her release and the Pentagon is yet to comment."" Trump tells countries, ""You want to do business with us, you need to knock off this shit."" And THAT'S why I can promise you that the Saudis didn't murder Jamal Khashoggi. If he's dead, the Turks or Iranians are responsible.","# ::snt TRUMP DOES IT AGAIN.
