No. My degree is Geology and Astronomy. I've studied Genetics and Microbiology at uni too. Yes there are genes that control impulse and IQ. These do not automatically translate into crime genes or all thick impulsive buggers would commit crime. As I said all along culture and learned behaviour leads to crime.
