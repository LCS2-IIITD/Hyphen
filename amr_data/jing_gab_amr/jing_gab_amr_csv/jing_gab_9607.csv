If you want to consider slaves and concubines and mistresses as wives then yes. But of legal wives not generally. In Viking society might made right for the most part so if some scattered Viking warlord wanted wives there wasn't a lot to stop him. But generally speaking European society = monogamy where legal wife is concerned. Why such a point of emotion for you anyway?,"# ::snt If you want to consider slaves and concubines and mistresses as wives then yes. But of legal wives not generally.
