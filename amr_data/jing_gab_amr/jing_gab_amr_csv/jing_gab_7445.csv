"This is exactly how the Soviets attempted to sow discord in the s & s. Complain about social disparities. Stir up the masses. Tell them they deserve better & to overthrow the status quo, which has conspired to keep everyone down. The antidote is to educate everyone on the methods & to have a booming economy that benefits everyone. Even so, those already sucked in are hard to break from the propaganda. Chelsea actually believes what she's saying in spite of how financially blessed she is. This is the power of propaganda.","# ::snt This is exactly how the Soviets attempted to sow discord in the s & s. Complain about social disparities. Stir up the masses.
