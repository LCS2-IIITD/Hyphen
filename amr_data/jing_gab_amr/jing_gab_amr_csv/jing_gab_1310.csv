"Perhaps I could put a finer point on this. I shouldn't call people shills for a mere viewpoint, but anyone calling me a shill should be viewed with a great deal of suspicion. I'm the most accountable guy in the movement. In any movement, for that matter. I take calls from the public, live on the air, and the frequent pranks and shitty calls should make it obvious that I'm not filtering for content. Despite my vocal dissatisfaction with Gab's lack of a block feature, I still use this as my primary social media platform, and lots of people who I muted forever ago still use my comments as a place to spread subversion. I rely upon my audience for my very sustenance, and the idea that I am being financed by powerful people is so profoundly ridiculous to anyone who knows anything about me, because living ""paycheck to paycheck"" would be a huge upgrade in my financial life. I've been banned from all major social media and payment platforms, and in all likelihood I am being ostracized by Mastercard and the highest echelons of the financial system. I put my life and freedom on the line for our cause, suffered tremendously for it, and remained vocally dedicated to our cause throughout all of it. It's entirely possible that I am completely wrong about everything I say. I've been corrected more times than I could list here. If something I am saying today needs to get added to that list, literally anyone can make the argument against it on MY PLATFORM and I will thoughtfully consider their viewpoint and respond honestly. To impugn my motives in the face of all this is so ridiculous that I must assume the people doing it are either batshit insane or acting with malice.","# ::snt Perhaps I could put a finer point on this.
