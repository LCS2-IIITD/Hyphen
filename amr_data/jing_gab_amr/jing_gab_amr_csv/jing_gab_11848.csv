"MGTOW is a defeatist ideology for sad lonely men who have been broken by evil women. MGTOW is also a necessary stepping stone in understanding female psychology, a subject that men have been totally kept in the dark about due to a lack of wisdom from their fathers and a lack of honesty and self-awareness from their mothers. But the deeper red pill is that men need to start acting like men again and reclaim their destiny and their women. MGTOW is a cop-out on that path. Quit your crying, and become the man you were meant to be.","# ::snt MGTOW is a defeatist ideology for sad lonely men who have been broken by evil women.

I would say: MGTOW is a defeatist ideology for sad lonely men who have never been successful with women. More MGTOW types have never really been with women at all than have been mistreated by them.. at least that is what I picked up from my discussions with these defeated men.,"# ::snt I would say: MGTOW is a defeatist ideology for sad lonely men who have never been successful with women.
