"Alleged Synagogue Shooter Was Avid Anti-Trump Nazi, Believed President Was Controlled by Jews ..... That really says it all. Bowers posted those sentiments regularly yet remarks made by some media saying that Andrew is responsible is truly bullshit and incitement against a site that doesn't promote such stuff! Frankly that's slanderous! Is anyone surprised that the left will aim this at the right?!? Typical of liberal media ... Placing blame erroneously to cover it's own incitement to violence. They have nothing else to offer but hatred..... -er-Cad","# ::snt Alleged Synagogue Shooter Was Avid Anti-Trump Nazi, Believed President Was Controlled by Jews ..... That really says it all.
