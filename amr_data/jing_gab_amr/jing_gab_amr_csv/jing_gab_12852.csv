"It is not school, it is indoctrination. I know I left college and basically regarded most of the professors as dumb as shit. I did not kiss a single ass in college. The professors people liked I hated, and the tough ones I loved. People thought I was nuts back then and that certainly has not changed. I tell the truth and people have a hard time with that becasue we certainly did not hear it in college! Universities need to be blown up!","# ::snt It is not school, it is indoctrination.
