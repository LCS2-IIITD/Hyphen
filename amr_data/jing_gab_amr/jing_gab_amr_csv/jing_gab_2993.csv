"nah, that's not all it does and quitting caffeine wouldn't be a substitute for it. For me, it gives me massive paranoia and I don't yawn or sleep for days. I got off of benzos earlier this year. I'm still trying to figure out how normal people sleep. Would be cool if I had a baseline sleep level to compare it to, but I don't. Anyway, Trazadone isn't worth the side effects.","# ::snt nah, that's not all it does and quitting caffeine wouldn't be a substitute for it.
