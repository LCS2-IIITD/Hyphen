"Carl ""It Depends On The Child"" Benjamin () agrees with 's stance against loli despite admitting its protected under free speech in US because its...reasonable? And because of the ""current climate"". Yeah, these aren't valid arguments. You are advocating for the ban of something because you don't like it & find it gross while allowing other things some people will dislike/find gross. This is getting really absurd & everytime Gab doubles down on this they just look worse. I still stand by my argument that it should all be allowed as long as its behind a NSFW filter with an accurate text description. However to do this Gab would need to fix an issue because the NSFW filter hides the text AND the image instead of just hiding the image.","# ::snt Carl ""It Depends On The Child"" Benjamin () agrees with 's stance against loli despite admitting its protected under free speech in US because its...reasonable?
