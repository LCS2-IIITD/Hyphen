I was working in a house in the same street that day (decorating) and despite going outside into the street for lots of cigarette breaks I never noticed anything odd and I only found out about it when I went past the bowling club a few days later and saw lots of football scarves tied to the railings. Seems like years ago now.,"# ::snt I was working in a house in the same street that day (decorating) and despite going outside into the street for lots of cigarette breaks I never noticed anything odd and I only found out about it when I went past the bowling club a few days later and saw lots of football scarves tied to the railings.
