Not sure what you are talking about here. A Dunkin' employee called the police just because somebody was speaking a foreign language. What 'nigger' did what before? The employee that made the call was white. The Somali did nothing at all other than to speak Somali to their family members so far as the article says. Do you have other information on this?,"# ::snt Not sure what you are talking about here. A Dunkin' employee called the police just because somebody was speaking a foreign language.
