"Gab was developed by Andrew Torba and his team. They have invested their time, money, and energy and built Gab from the ground up. Their work deserves to be rewarded with success. Therefore, to all the lolishills and the others working tirelessly to tear Gab down (especially those who whine about ""muh free speech"" because Andrew won't let them post child porn): Invest YOUR time, YOUR money, and YOUR energy in building YOUR own platform, where you can write the Terms of Service and take all the risks for the behavior of the people who post on YOUR platform. DO something instead of complaining. Build something instead of tearing something down. You want to post loliporn? Build a platform where you can do it. But realize: YOU don't get to make the rules. YOU don't get any say in the TOS. YOU aren't risking anything if Gab goes down. Abide by the terms of service or leave. It really is that simple. BTW: If you REALLY want to post your cartoon child porn somewhere, get all the pictures you want to post, walk out into the middle of a busy freeway, and post them on the front of speeding cars.","# ::snt Gab was developed by Andrew Torba and his team.
