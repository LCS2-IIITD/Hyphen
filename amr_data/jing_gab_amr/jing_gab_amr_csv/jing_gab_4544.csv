"Stay at home moms are freeloading leeches? They still pay property taxes if they own a home which directly funds all public schools and the average cost to homeschool a kid PER YEAR is $500 compared to almost $10,000 for a public school kid. Those pesky facts I tell you. Trump needs to create programs like Hungary did where families get free grants or major tax breaks to encourage millions of women to be stay at home moms and homeschool their kids. If /4 of American households would we would save BILLIONS of dollars per year.","# ::snt Stay at home moms are freeloading leeches?
