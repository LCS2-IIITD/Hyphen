"My goal in running as a Nationally Social Democratic American Patriot in the Democrat Presidential primary was to either: A: force Trump to name the jew (USS Liberty, Lavon Affair, NUMEC stolen uranium, jew involvement in , JFK assassination , Patton assassination , assassination of Jim Traffcant etc) if he wanted to be able to run as ""American First"" in without me calling him an israel-firster. or B: defeat a what would be then an israel-firster GOP incumbent in the general election. Now my goal in running for POTUS is also to free the RAM political prisoners as well as the other political prisoners of the jews in this country. I have been victims of jewish-sponsored terrorist group assaults that were politically motivated and pre-meditated, with plenty of video footage proving we were attacked, unprovoked, without even trying to exercise our right to self defense in Washington state. I have been assaulted again since then for criticism of jewish power, and knew that if I defended myself, that I would become a political prisoner (like the RAM guys and others are now). The police in every state I have filed charges with surplus of evidence of assault have dropped the charges against the assailants. The US is quickly becoming like the USSR before wwii where the penalty for criticism of jews was death. I will not tolerate a President who continues to allow the jews to imprison all of their political enemies. This is AMERICA, not the s USSR. If Trump doesn't stop allowing the jews to use law enforcement as a GPU/Cheka against the goyim who speak out, I will have no choice but to defeat him in November . If Trump names the jew and stops allowing jews to make our law enforcement into the NKVD, I will drop out of the race and endorse him. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND!","# ::snt My goal in running as a Nationally Social Democratic American Patriot in the Democrat Presidential primary was to either: A: force Trump to name the jew (USS Liberty, Lavon Affair, NUMEC stolen uranium, jew involvement in , JFK assassination , Patton assassination , assassination of Jim Traffcant etc) if he wanted to be able to run as ""American First"" in without me calling him an israel-firster. or B: defeat a what would be then an israel-firster GOP incumbent in the general election.
