"Twitter is imploding. These suspensions are having the opposite effect, in that when people hear about them, they begin networking with the suspended party. A bond is formed, and word gets out. Jack Dorsey will be blamed for the Democrats' midterm bloodbath, because he's created a grapevine of angry voters who are becoming more and more informed about leftist social-media moguls' attempts to silence dissent. Watch Jack go down in flames. And then laugh at him.","# ::snt Twitter is imploding.
