BAN ICE ( shhh dont tell anyone they can throw bar stools ) Then we move to jail the bar owner for facilitating the use of ice in a crime at the same time denouncing mother nature for her allowing the recipe to be stolen ! What absolute fkn idiocy !,"# ::snt Wow ! He tossed ice at a guy in a bar fight... Well that settles it ...
