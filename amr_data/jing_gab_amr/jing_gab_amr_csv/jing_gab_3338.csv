"Race-haters on Gab poll.What percentage are shills to damage pro-white causes? (For added clarity: Hate is understandable, but ineffective, and a naive too, imo. Know your enemy, but be strategic. Nonstrategic vitriol drives potential sympathizers away. In fact, vitriolic hatred is what a shill might do to taint a movement.) I don't usually use the word ""racist"" because it's overly used. I'll use the term ""race-hater"" to refer to someone who just spews hatred publicly and tactlessly. Are race-haters on Gab shills that want to taint the otherwise cordial race awareness dialog? What percentage do you think might be shills? Or are they being genuinely vitriolic? (e.g. You can like in-group preference and ethnostates while not hating others. You can fight wars and not be driven by hatred.)","# ::snt Race-haters on Gab poll.What percentage are shills to damage pro-white causes?
