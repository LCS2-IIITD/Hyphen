"Labour Rising Star Mohammed Pappu Accused of Spreading Anti-Israel Conspiracy Theories Israelstaged /11, the London bombings and the Paris terrorist attacks, according to social media posts attributed to arising Labour party star who is personally endorsed by leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mohammed Pappu, , a newly electedcouncillorin the London borough of Tower Hamlets, was praised by hard-left Jeremy Corbyn last month for his help to create a fair, just and decent society. However, areportin theTimesnewspaper paints a different picture of Mr Pappu. The newspaperalleges he publicly shared messages overFacebookaccusing Britain of attacking Syria to install a Rothschild bank as well as other posts claiming thatIsraelhad staged /11, the London bombings and the Paris terrorist attacks. Mr Pappu, an Uber driver, also reportedly uploaded a sermon in which he proclaimed The Smurfs and Halloween were demonic and occult-related, therefore should be avoided by observant Muslim families to protect themselves from the burning torment of Hell. He is backed by the pro-Corbyn Momentum activist group and won the vote to become the black and ethnic minority officer for London Young Labour in February. In another controversial post over Facebook, he shared a photograph of President Assad of Syria and his wife, Asma, with an illustrative cartoon speech bubble: Why does the West want to invade Syria? Assad responded: To rob our oil, put in a puppet government and install a Rothschild bank! He resigned from all his council posts yesterday and apologised unreservedly aftertheTimesconfronted him about his digital trail across social media. He also referred himself to the authoritys standards procedure. The national Labour executive is understood to have suspended him pending an investigation. Mr Pappu is a trustee and former chairman of Soul (Social Organisation for Unity and Leisure), a charity that organises sports activities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. His Facebook account was intended to be read by children as he used it until at least for updates on timings, cancellations, kick-offs and training for teams as young as under-tens. The charity has launched an immediate safeguarding review. The revelations come just -hours afterIsraels ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon,saidMr Corbynis an anti-Semite who wants to return Britain to dark periods in history. Mr Corbyn has previously welcomed friends from Hezbollah and Hamas Islamist terror groups sworn to the destruction of Israel into parliament and recently admitted attendingconferenceswith Hamas members and awreath layingat the grave of an anti-Semitic terrorist. Footage has also surfaced of himcomparingthe state of Israel to Nazi Germany a commonly recognised example of anti-Semitism.","# ::snt Labour Rising Star Mohammed Pappu Accused of Spreading Anti-Israel Conspiracy Theories Israelstaged /11, the London bombings and the Paris terrorist attacks, according to social media posts attributed to arising Labour party star who is personally endorsed by leader Jeremy Corbyn.
