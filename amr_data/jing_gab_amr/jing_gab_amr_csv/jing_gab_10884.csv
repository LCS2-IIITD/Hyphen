"Let's assume that Gab stopped being for free speech. Let's assume that they blocked everyone that YOU think should be blocked. Let's further assume that absolutely EVERYONE on the internet did the same. Do you honestly believe it would make a difference in what happened today? There is madness and evil in the world. If you close your eyes to it then you'll always be surprised when it surfaces. As long as people are talking, there's a chance that you can change minds, open hearts. You can take everyone else's freedoms away. You can give up your own. It won't make you safe. It'll only make you blind to the dangers.","# ::snt Let's assume that Gab stopped being for free speech.
