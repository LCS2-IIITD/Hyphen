"It's that time of year again in New England, when the leaves turn yellow and red. Time for apple picking, and apple cider. Time to select a big pumpkin to carve into a Jack-O-Lantern later this month. Time to give thanks for a bountiful harvest, and stack wood for the coming Winter's cold and snow. Life is good.","# ::snt It's that time of year again in New England, when the leaves turn yellow and red. Time for apple picking, and apple cider.
