So, imagine my surprise when I found this gem as soon as I logged on. It starts off soon so hang in there Episode is more like a prologue A necessary intro. I jumped in at episode and while I could easily follow along I still was missing huge chunks of info (from fellow Patriots and Anons) that I missed along the way. Sometimes things don't reach us on Twitter. It's imparative to for us to get all the information we can. Videos are the key.
