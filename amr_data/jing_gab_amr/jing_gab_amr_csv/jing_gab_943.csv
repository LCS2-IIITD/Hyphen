"The Sydney Morning Herald: There's a solution to the refugee crisis - but no one will like it. Ridiculous! So the single women, families and unaccompanied 'children' get into Australia, with all it's enticing benefits. 'Family reunion' will then kick in and in pour hordes more, all at the taxpayers expense. These illegal immigrant economic forum seekers are in no sense, whatsoever, detained on Manus Island or Nauru. They are totally free to go anywhere on Earth they wish, except Australia and New Zealand (New Zealand being the unlocked back door to Australia). The Australian taxpayer will pay their airfares and even provide a generous resettlement allowance. Why don't they go? We all know why.","# ::snt The Sydney Morning Herald: There's a solution to the refugee crisis - but no one will like it. Ridiculous!
