Lol What exactly is your point with this pic Fraggle Rock? You've been sending it to me for weeks now. I didn't say these ARE bodies being taken to the crematoria after just being killed. It looks like bodies were being moved after the camp was liberated. What I said was the Nazis possibly used carts LIKE this to move bodies.,"# ::snt Lol What exactly is your point with this pic Fraggle Rock? You've been sending it to me for weeks now.
