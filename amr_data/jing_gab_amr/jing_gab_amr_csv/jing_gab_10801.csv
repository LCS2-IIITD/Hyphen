"Don't know much about Ethanol and affects it has on engines and pollution. But if this helps US farmers and gives us more choice on biofuel or fuel for the matter, i'm for it. How bad can it be if made from Corn? We know fossil fuel is very pollutant and deadly, so why the uproar on Corn fuel? It's creating jobs and driving US farm. Cheaper gas? I'm for it.","# ::snt Don't know much about Ethanol and affects it has on engines and pollution. But if this helps US farmers and gives us more choice on biofuel or fuel for the matter, i'm for it.
