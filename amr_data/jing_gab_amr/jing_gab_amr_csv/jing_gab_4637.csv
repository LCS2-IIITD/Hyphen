"I can say being a woman, I have known more skanks than good women in my + years. That is why I have had few friends. Just a fact, but the good women always are looked at as if they are the skanks. I am sorry the skanks did you men and women wrong, but not all women are skanks. I have to keep from wanting to knee-cap idiots that generalize. Just like most men I have met are snakes in the grass. Either way, few ""REAL"" good people exist. As always has been the case the %er's who not only talk but do good who were the ones I stood with, and still do! That is why the %er's do not care what others think, say, or do. It will not change the facts about what is right is right, what is wrong is wrong. Just like the old timey's use to say, I don't want you to do what you are going to do...because I know what I have to do when you do. -DevilDog","# ::snt I can say being a woman, I have known more skanks than good women in my + years.
