"I noticed in your bio that it says you're a ""recovering liberal"", which is fine because we all come from different backgrounds, but you're obviously still in recovery mode and have yet to beat the disease if you truly think people like myself are your enemy. All of the things you claim to hate have one very important thing in common, but you're still under kosher control, so you fail to recognize exactly what that is. We, on the other hand, have diagnosed the disease and offer the remedy, while you'd rather spend your time complaining about the symptoms and wishing death on those of us who want to see them cured. There's a reason why Fascism and National Socialism are the most smeared ideologies by our real enemies. The reason is, they get to the core of our problems and offer an actual solution to them. I used to believe the lies surrounding both ideologies until I stopped consuming the kosher narratives about them and researched it for myself. Once you realize that the main people who have been telling you about how ""evil"" those ideologies are, are also the same ones pushing everything you hate, then you might finally wake up and see things clearly. Instead of wishing death on me, I recommend you watch the, ""The Ultimate Red Pill"", documentary to get your feet wet and hopefully change your perspective on things.","# ::snt I noticed in your bio that it says you're a ""recovering liberal"", which is fine because we all come from different backgrounds, but you're obviously still in recovery mode and have yet to beat the disease if you truly think people like myself are your enemy.
