"If you're fighting for a political goal, and everything you do makes you feel good, you're probably going to lose that political fight. What makes you a threat to your political enemies is a willingness to be SERIOUS and do the uncomfortable things that are necessary for victory. Voting Republican costs you NOTHING, so if you're on here bitching about the many things the GOP has done over the years that White nationalists understandably have issues with, three weeks before a major election, instead of doing what is necessary to keep the Left at bay, you're just a virtue signaling purity spiraler who poses absolutely no threat to your enemies whatsoever.","# ::snt If you're fighting for a political goal, and everything you do makes you feel good, you're probably going to lose that political fight.
