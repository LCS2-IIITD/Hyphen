"It's a cop out if Senator Daines doesn't vote. Senate Rule XXVI allows for him to send a proxy to vote in his place. ""The practice of allowing a senator to cast a vote in committee for an absent senator. Senate Rule XXVI provides that proxies may not be voted when the absent senator has not been informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has not requested that he be so recorded."" All Senator Daines has to do is declare his vote and inform the Senate that he will be sending a proxy. Senator is well aware of what he is voting on ahead of the vote so his vote can be recorded.","# ::snt It's a cop out if Senator Daines doesn't vote.
