"In a bizarre clip... It is bizarre to see a black person hate themselves that much, or really any other race, except for whites. Whites hate themselves so regularly it is not considered strange. It would not be unusual or interesting to see a self-hating white girl, plagued with guilt on TV, because its so common.","# ::snt In a bizarre clip...
