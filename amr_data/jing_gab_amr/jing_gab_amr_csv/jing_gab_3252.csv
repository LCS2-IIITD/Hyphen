"I'm tellin' you guys... the left is going to get worse. A lot worse. I think that a lot of us kind of feel removed from this stuff because it's only happening in cities like Portland or LA or Charlottesville... but it's coming to where you live & it'll be here sooner than you think. Fact is- Our media feeds their anger & insanity... on purpose. These people, who are already unhinged- are being told that everyone who isn't a commie is a racist, sexist bigot who's planning on taking away their abortions & kicking off slave plantations. These people are being fed a steady diet of anti-white anti-conservative propaganda & this is by design... because then you have the next rung in the ladder who steps in & does their part. Our government & legal system. If you think they're on your side, you haven't been paying attention. I do not care how non-racist, kind, God fearing, socially liberal you are... if you are white you will be a target. You, no matter how much you say otherwise- are an evil white oppressive Nazi. That's just how it is- and because of this, in most cases it's going to be open season on you, your family, & your property. The legal system won't help you, the government isn't going to step in & stop groups like Antifa... if they were, they would have already done so. Instead, they allow them to do what they want. The left & their little storm trooper organizations like Antifa or BLM feel justified in what they do. They feel that they have the right to physically attack people or destroy their shit, because, in reality they are. I can't count how many videos I've seen of police just standing by watching people get beaten with pipes or bike locks or pepper sprayed & then mauled by people. How many have gotten into legal trouble for these things? How many have gotten anything other than probation? Now... how many times have we seen conservatives who were simply defending themselves have their lives ruined? Of course the left feels justified in attacking you- the same laws that are applied to you are not applied to them. Nobody is coming to save us. No government agency is going to step in & stop this, because, as we've seen from a lot of the Veritas videos & other independent media- our government is absolutely filled with people who don't want you to exist. We're on our own here, people & the only ones who can fix this or change these things is us. If we don't & if we don't get serious about doing so- what you see happening in these cities, these attacks on people & property are going to become everyday norms for all of us.","# ::snt I'm tellin' you guys... the left is going to get worse.
