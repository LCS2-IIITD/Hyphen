"This is quite a stunning performance from Amsterdam, featuring Janine Jansen on the violin backed by a fine orchestra. Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Not only was the performance impeccable, but the obvious emotion and love that went into the work was on full display. I hope you enjoy this. Note: Starting at about the :40 mark, it's during the Spring season part, and you can actually hear her violin imitating the birds singing, so enjoy!","# ::snt This is quite a stunning performance from Amsterdam, featuring Janine Jansen on the violin backed by a fine orchestra.
