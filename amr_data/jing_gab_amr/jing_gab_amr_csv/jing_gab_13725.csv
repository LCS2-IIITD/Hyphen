"Hello, Folks! Quick Update: I've been back home on the east coast for the past few weeks continuing to animate the long-awaited sequel of Waking Up. Some more green screen skits and short films are in the works as well, including A Clockwork Orange parody that I'll be filming this month. Very excited to get back to the creative grind. Stay Tuned for Previews!","# ::snt Hello, Folks! Quick Update: I've been back home on the east coast for the past few weeks continuing to animate the long-awaited sequel of Waking Up.
