"I pray for this day and night -- Trump needs stream it to Pay-per-View, get his wall funds in two days. I want to witness them breaking rocks into smaller rocks, getting waterboarded, and prison shanked... Up to the day of their tribunal and execution. I want to see them place the rope around their necks and see their feet twitching... Then I will be able to sleep again knowing it will be at least another -60 years before they test the waters in America once more...","# ::snt I pray for this day and night -- Trump needs stream it to Pay-per-View, get his wall funds in two days.
