"Cory Booker, Best Known for the Forced Groping of HS Classmates, Launched his Presidential Campaign this Weekend Just hours after casting a vote in one of the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation battles in history, Cory Booker stepped on stage in a packed Iowa conference hall and unofficially launched his campaign. Speaking before energized Democrats at the partys premier Fall Gala event, the New Jersey senator acknowledged their likely feelings of defeat and of anger after the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh earlier that day. He then delved into race struggles, poverty, his own personal political defeats and finding faith, despite it all. If other top-tier potential contenders werent rethinking their decision to avoid Iowa this far in advance of , they might be now. Booker had the room silently mesmerized at some points, and won roaring standing ovations at others. How long will it take? Im going to tell you not long now, Booker roared, quoting from Martin Luther King Jr.s legendary speech in Montgomery, Alabama. Because its not long until November!","# ::snt Cory Booker, Best Known for the Forced Groping of HS Classmates, Launched his Presidential Campaign this Weekend Just hours after casting a vote in one of the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation battles in history, Cory Booker stepped on stage in a packed Iowa conference hall and unofficially launched his campaign.
