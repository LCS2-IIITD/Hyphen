In a sense you have. When you see heathens advocating outright murder of white Christians .... I've certainly seen it. Thankfully this is a small minority in no way representative of folk religion as a whole.,"# ::snt In a sense you have. When you see heathens advocating outright murder of white Christians ....

"Indeed -- I have seen at least one case of this, of someone claiming to be folkish stating that ""all christians get the bullet"" or the like. I'm sure if you just search for ""get the bullet"" or ""christians get the bullet"" you'll find it. Obviously due to the nature of what we are doing, this sort of thing CAN come from infiltrators rather than serious people; which is why I don't use these instances to paint with a broad brush. What *has* shocked me when I have seen such statements is a lack of condemnation of them. But that could be because a lot of people mute such maniacs and so never see what they say.","# ::snt Indeed -- I have seen at least one case of this, of someone claiming to be folkish stating that ""all christians get the bullet"" or the like.

What is the one and only religion attacked and derided without penalty by JEWISH CONTROLLED media? Is it Judaism? Islam? Hinduism? Dianic Feminist Wicca? Druidry? No -- it is Christianity. When Christian prayers were removed from schools, who funded that? Jews. When Christian displays are removed from public places, who funds that litigation? Jews. Who planned and executed the subversion of the Vatican resulting in Vatican ? Jews. Who planned and executed the systematic subversion of numerous Christian theological schools? Jews. Who wrote and propagated the poisonous Schofield Bible propagating so-called Christian Zionism? A Jew. Whether or not Christianity is objectively good or bad for European peoples is something that can be reasonably debated. But what cannot be debated is that when you take a specifically anti-Christian stance (as opposed to a pro-pagan one) you are absolutely joining forces with Jews to achieve what is also a Jewish objective. Too damned bad you can't cooperate with woke Christians against organized Jewish interests, huh? And yet one more tack: According to McNallen who is in a position to know, there are only about k pagans in the entire US. Meanwhile, fully Americans are leaving Christianity every year. But they aren't becoming pagans. The default being pushed by the globalist now is a rational materialistic atheism. THIS is the philosophy that CURRENTLY is preferred by the globalists. It is every bit as dangerous and damaging as you believe Christianity to be, as the number of Aryans dying with needles stuck in their arms will attest. Attacking Christianity does NOT get you new pagans. If you successfully destroy someone's Christian faith, you are more likely to get an atheistic materialist.

Just like in WWII when my great uncle was drafted -- he participated because if he didn't he would have been penalized.

Today, liberalism does the exact same things -- punishes people for heresy and the like. It's not about religion, or the religion of the common people. It's about control. If you think its okay to join the Jews in attacking white Christian brothers so they will become rational atheistic materialists, that's just fine.

"I don't want to argue it either. I don't think that is really my argument -- in fact I have not been arguing pro-christian at all. I am arguing pro-not-killing-each-other. Let me give you an example. For over a decade I have directly or indirectly promoted Odinism in particular. Back when I did a podcast, I interviewed Odinists as guests, I positively reviewed their books, etc. At various times over the past decade I have made financial contributions to both the Asatru Folk Assembly and the Odinic Rite. Back last fall when one pagan started producing a magazine, I gave it positive reviews on my news site, bought many copies of it and distributed it, etc. As recently as a week ago I pointed a friend to the Odinic Rite. For years I had nothing but positive worthwhile interactions with Odinists who are unambiguously good people with good goals. Maybe in the grand scheme of things what I was doing had no value. I don't know. But my interactions on Gab have soured me significantly. Not because I have been trying to convert pagans to christianity (which would be a pro christian position) but because I have argued against attacking PRO-WHITE people who are Christians. For that, these pagans have quite frankly for the most part treated me abominably. And as a result, I have most certainly stopped any promotion of their creators etc. Now -- WHO has benefited from the fact they have lost my financial and promotional support? As I said, my own personal religious views are complex. Were they known, specifically my belief in the truth of orlog, no christian would call me christian. Even so, because I am formally theologically trained, I agree that by definition NO Christian keeps the law. Were it not so, they would not require a savior. But beyond that, any reasonable Christian and certainly the pro-white ones know their churches are mostly subverted and most people who call themselves Christians ... are not.","# ::snt I don't want to argue it either.
