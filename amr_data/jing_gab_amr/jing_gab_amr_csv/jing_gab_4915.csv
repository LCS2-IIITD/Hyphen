"THE FILM THE LEFT TRIED TO ABORT After a mighty struggle, the film, Gosnell: The Trial of Americas Biggest Serial Killer, finally opened in movie theaters nationwide on Oct. . Like the effort to prosecute a real-life monster, Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the effort to make the movie was hindered at every turn because the Left studiously avoids doing anything that might call into question abortion on demand, its holiest of sacraments. Indeed, support for unrestricted access to abortion unites the entire Left, from labor unions to Alinskyite community organizations to environmentalist groups to race-baiting legal defense funds.","# ::snt THE FILM THE LEFT TRIED TO ABORT After a mighty struggle, the film, Gosnell: The Trial of Americas Biggest Serial Killer, finally opened in movie theaters nationwide on Oct. .
