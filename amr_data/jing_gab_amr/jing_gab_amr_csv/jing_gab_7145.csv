"""Race Traitor of the Week Award"" goes to Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She has released result of her DNA examination, revealing that she has approx. one-percent American Indian DNA. That's the heritage she identifies with: the % non-White, not the % White. This is more than just a lack of White pride, it is racial self-loathing.","# ::snt ""Race Traitor of the Week Award"" goes to Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
