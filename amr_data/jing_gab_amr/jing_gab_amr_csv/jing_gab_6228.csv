", please remove ALL pornography and all links to pornography from the Gab platform. We really DO NOT need this, and it only degrades and lowers the standard of this great platform. Gab WILL BE the next Facebook and it is crucial that this stuff is removed. I love and support Gab, and will continue to do so, but honestly, we really dont need this stuff! Fellow Gabbers, if you agree I would appreciate you liking and reposting this. Thank you","# ::snt , please remove ALL pornography and all links to pornography from the Gab platform.
