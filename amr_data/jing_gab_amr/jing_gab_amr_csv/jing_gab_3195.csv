"Torba, I am now % FOR Gab's proposed ""Disassociate"" feature. I was on the fence about it until last night after I was doxxed by some psycho that I triggered more than months ago who decided they were gonna dig into my life and ""expose me as a charlatan"" even going so far as doing a freedom of information request on me. Nothing was really exposing in my situation, but I can just imagine what could happen if someone had a post go viral and their stalker decided to post a dox that exposed someone's kids' schools or other personal identifying information at the optimal time of visibility. A user can act must faster than the in protecting their personal data with that feature. Sure, it may be used to silence dissent, but securing the safety of Gabbers personal data from predatory practices is critical. , ,","# ::snt Torba, I am now % FOR Gab's proposed ""Disassociate"" feature.
