"Torba or one of his slaves are free to ban everybody posting loli ecchi, but the backlash from the free speech community won't like it. Banning content that is LEGAL for MORAL reasons? Banning loli hentai at least had a [weak] legal excuse and sparked backlash but loli ecchi? It would be disastrous for GAB's ""free speech"" claims. So go on, do it - kill GAB.","# ::snt Torba or one of his slaves are free to ban everybody posting loli ecchi, but the backlash from the free speech community won't like it.
