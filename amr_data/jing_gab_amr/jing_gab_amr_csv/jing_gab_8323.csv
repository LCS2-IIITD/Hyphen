"As long as republicans aren't outright discouraged from going to the polls by information that seems too bleak, I think it's important to make it seem like we need to fight hard to make a blue wave not happen. A narrative of ""we can stop it if we just turn out"" is way better than a narrative of ""the blue wave was horseshit we have this in the bag"". Complacency sinks more ships than loose lips, that's for sure.","# ::snt As long as republicans aren't outright discouraged from going to the polls by information that seems too bleak, I think it's important to make it seem like we need to fight hard to make a blue wave not happen.
