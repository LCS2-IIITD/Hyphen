"I wasn't interested because he remained civil, but then he made that odd statement. Given the low proportion of the US jewish population that joins the military compared to Whites and given that even israel has not been sending troops to fight in the Iraq wars or in Afghanistan. therefore this guy's comment that he had jews to the left and the right of him on the battlefield would be likely a nonsense. Then if you look at his account and see one straight down the line normie comment after another. Odds on that it's a hasbara. Unfortunately for the gameplan that they run by, we're not born again yesterday and actually don't take comments at face value, because unlike his (or her) comment, we actually do have jews on our left and right, all the time. lying about everything. At least it wasn't posting skat porn i suppose. "" Rob Bee I dont remember seeing you on the battlefield during our latest round of wars... no disrespect intended... however, I do recall seeing plenty of US Jewish Soldiers onmy left and right.
