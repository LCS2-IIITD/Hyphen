"I 'dream' and have visions so imagine my surprise when I dreamt of US Mil at the southern border, barbed wire fence (the big round on the ground type) and even runner being shot and this was the night before Trump said he would send the Military if the caravan wasn't stopped. They are now camping on a bridge from Guatemala to Mexico. Tags for, saucy notables and Breaking News:The list is getting lengthy and if you don't have a Pro account you can't hit the star and favourite an account/Gabber so I've created a topic which you can do that to. There is space for a couple more adds to this list. Thank you all so much. -BELLA","# ::snt I 'dream' and have visions so imagine my surprise when I dreamt of US Mil at the southern border, barbed wire fence (the big round on the ground type) and even runner being shot and this was the night before Trump said he would send the Military if the caravan wasn't stopped.
