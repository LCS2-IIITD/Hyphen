In a sense you have. When you see heathens advocating outright murder of white Christians .... I've certainly seen it. Thankfully this is a small minority in no way representative of folk religion as a whole.,"# ::snt In a sense you have. When you see heathens advocating outright murder of white Christians ....

"Indeed -- I have seen at least one case of this, of someone claiming to be folkish stating that ""all christians get the bullet"" or the like. I'm sure if you just search for ""get the bullet"" or ""christians get the bullet"" you'll find it. Obviously due to the nature of what we are doing, this sort of thing CAN come from infiltrators rather than serious people; which is why I don't use these instances to paint with a broad brush. What *has* shocked me when I have seen such statements is a lack of condemnation of them. But that could be because a lot of people mute such maniacs and so never see what they say.","# ::snt Indeed -- I have seen at least one case of this, of someone claiming to be folkish stating that ""all christians get the bullet"" or the like.
