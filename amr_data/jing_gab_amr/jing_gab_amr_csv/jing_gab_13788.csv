Im not a Dr Who fan but I'm sick and tired of traditionally male roles being given to women. I wouldn't want Ripley to be played by a guy in Alien. I wouldn't want Lara Croft to be played by a guy in Tomb Raider. So why are all the male roles always being hijacked by the muh... diversity! brigade?,"# ::snt Im not a Dr Who fan but I'm sick and tired of traditionally male roles being given to women.
