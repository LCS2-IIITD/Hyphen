"Uh no. The massive majority of the %-ers were Christian. The DoI and the Constitution were signed in ""the year of our Lord"" and dated in the Christian year, AD. The DoI mentions the ""Creator"" and says that the Creator gave us our rights. The House, Senate, and SCOTUS begin in prayer to Christ, and our ""mal in se"" laws are based on God's law as found in the OT. Most of the original colonies and many states added later had bars against atheists taking public office. Texas, for example, has a Constitutional requirement to believe in a God. The President ends speeches, ""God bless the United States (or America)"" I could go on and on with the proof that this nation was founded a Christian nation.","# ::snt Uh no.
