"Good luck with the future recruiting Army. How do you say army strong, bring your own machete in Arabic? Pretty sad when the recruits know right from wrong and their superiors have their heads stuck up the left's arse. Since when does the army condone rape grooming gangs? Clearly the BA needs it's own Joan of Arc.","# ::snt Good luck with the future recruiting Army. How do you say army strong, bring your own machete in Arabic?
