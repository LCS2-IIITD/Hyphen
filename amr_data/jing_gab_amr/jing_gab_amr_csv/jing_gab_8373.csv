"A Black school teacher, Shonterikka Williams, was fried after she told her Asian student to be less chinky & stop doing oriental things. The Black teachers defense: this is the war on black women and she cant personally be racist to Asians because they are closer to white people in terms of supremacy. These are the people teaching your kids.","# ::snt A Black school teacher, Shonterikka Williams, was fried after she told her Asian student to be less chinky & stop doing oriental things.
