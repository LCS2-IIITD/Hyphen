I keep hearing people complain that Trump isn't /ourguy/ and he hasn't done enough to fill his promises re: the Wall. Both those statements are definitely true. What he has done for us is send the Left into a frothing rage that redpills more people every day. He has also trolled the MSM into losing what few shards of credibility it had left. Neither of those things would have happened under an HRC presidency.,"# ::snt I keep hearing people complain that Trump isn't /ourguy/ and he hasn't done enough to fill his promises re: the Wall.
