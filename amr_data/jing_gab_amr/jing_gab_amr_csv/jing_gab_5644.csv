"Just in case you're sitting on the fence about this invasion coming our way, think about this. Do you believe Hondurans woke up a few days ago and decided now is the time to move to America? Of course not. Common sense tells us this is an event. This was planned. It appears they'll arrive right around election day. Coincidence? Hell no! So who's behind this? Do we really care? I don't think President Trump picked up the phone and called Jose and told him to gather up all his friends and head this way. Outside of Trump making the call, I wouldn't put it past ANYONE else with political ties! So who the hell cares who's responsible. Fact is, this has to be stopped and Trump is the only one I trust to stop it. So, no matter what the media says, no matter what you see on television or the internet, even when they zoom the cameras in on the women and children they're using as props, don't fall off on the wrong side of the fence. After what the Democrats did to Judge Kavanaugh, there is absolutely NOTHING that would surprise me now. These people are evil.","# ::snt Just in case you're sitting on the fence about this invasion coming our way, think about this.
