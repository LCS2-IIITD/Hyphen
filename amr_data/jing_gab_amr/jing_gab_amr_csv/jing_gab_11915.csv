"BBC headline about rise in ""hate crime"" towards Muslims (who are % of the UK population). Read the article and it turns out that the % of the population who are gay report far more ""hate crime"" than do Muslims. Never mind that there's no organisation out there that solicits gays to report ""hate crime"". Yet the British state funds Muslim organisations to lie about ""hate crime"" against Muslims. Clearly the BBC couldn't give a fuck about attacks on gays. For every Muslim who claims they were a victim, there are nearly x as many gays who are claiming to be victims. Only Muslims matter when it comes to ""hate crime"".","# ::snt BBC headline about rise in ""hate crime"" towards Muslims (who are % of the UK population).
