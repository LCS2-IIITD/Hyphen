"After Twitter banned me, they reported me to the FBI, who came to my house to interview me. Now, even though I get death threats, I never lose my head. I would NEVER have done what Lakeland City Commissioner Michael Dunn did. The video is brutal but not gruesome. You see a man shot to death. So far I've had two intruders come on to my property. One was a Chinese woman who stole a very expensive tree aloe. I did NOT confront her, because I KNOW THE LAWS, and I'm not eager to use my firearms. Instead, I followed her home. She lives in a gated community, but she was so oblivious that I was able to slip in behind her after she used the keypad. After I got her address, I called the cops, who retrieved the tree aloe. I asked the deputy to be honest, and he advised me to not press charges. The woman and her daughter were already pretending to not understand English, and the deputy said that without a doubt they would file a civil suit, claiming RACISM on my part. But the deputy told the woman and her daughter to never even come onto my street again, because if I ever made any more complaints, he'd go right to their house. The second intruder crashed over my fence into my back yard at :00 a.m. He was thrashing around in the bushes. I armed myself and used my secret passageway, and I saw that it was the kid across the alley. He'd kicked his soccer ball into my yard and had jumped the fence to retrieve it. Neither the Chinese thief nor the soccer-ball kid were in any danger, EVEN THOUGH I GET DEATH THREATS. I've arranged my house and the two adjacent properties to allow me to see what's happening. Intruders can't see me. Despite Twitter's MALICIOUS report to the FBI, I am not a threat to anyone--except for those who threaten ME, on MY property. But by keeping my head, I was able to see that the two intruders I mentioned above did not pose a threat. AND in , two women home-invaded my parents. My brother and I caught them in the act. I was angry enough to shoot them. However, I DID NOT. I didn't even point my handgun at them. I kept it by my side, visible but not aimed at anyone. My father insisted that we let the home invaders go. He was terrified of criminals coming back for revenge, so I did as he asked, but I also reported them to the cops, who later arrested them. They were targeting elderly people all over Southern California. California has become totally lawless, now that Jerry Brown redefined violent felonies and eliminated money bail. It's impossible to jail criminals. BUT. I still keep my head. As the FBI knows, I am not a threat. Leftists like Jack Dorsey are a threat. They make entire states lawless, which results in what you see in the video. I said on Twitter that when the police stand down, citizens take the law into their own hands. Leftism gets people killed. I myself have never killed anyone. People like me are not the problem.","# ::snt After Twitter banned me, they reported me to the FBI, who came to my house to interview me.
