"""Hellstorm"" is the most shocking & disturbing book I have ever read. I can believe that WW2 was really just a crusade by the Babylonian Roman Church to finally annihilate the German Christian nation. They had used WW1 to turn the two nations responsible for the Reformation and spreading the Word of God Britain & Germany (by newer and more accurate translations of the Bible and the printing press) against each other for the purpose of mutual self-destruction.","# ::snt ""Hellstorm"" is the most shocking & disturbing book I have ever read.
