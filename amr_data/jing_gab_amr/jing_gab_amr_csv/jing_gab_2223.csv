"Excuse me, but WHAT?!!! I have MET people who KNEW Prabhupda in the s. And several who knew him in the s and s. Blood?!!! I don't remember ever hearing about the need to consume BLOOD! Katriyas perhaps are allowed to consume meat, but brahmacrs, gihasthas, or sannyss?! Absolutely NOT! Only in a life or death situation should they do so.","# ::snt Excuse me, but WHAT?!!!
