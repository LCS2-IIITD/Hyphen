Yet again this is a false argument. Looking at animated pornography doesn't prevent anyone from looking at real pornography or having real sex with someone. Neither would looking at animated child pronography prevent a pedophile from looking at real child pronography or having sex with a real child. This is pedophile propaganda used to try to get you to allow them to step by step encroach upon the norms of our society with their degeneracy.,"# ::snt Yet again this is a false argument.
