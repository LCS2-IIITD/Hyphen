"Ann Coulter on Gab (1:07-1:57): A lot of things used to seem indispensable, like buggy whips and MySpace. You're not always indispensable. And all of this censorship isn't that popular. Something will come along to displace youthough it is admittedly difficult in the case of social media giants like Facebook and Twitter. Especially Gabyou know, Gab was the alternative to Twitter that wasn't going to censor people. Yet they gettheir bank refuses to do business with them, Google won't carry them, the server pulls out on them. You know, It's one thing to say, ""Well, if you don't like how Twitter or Google do business, just start your own."" Okay, but do we have to lay our own internet lines? Do we have to build our own bank first? attn","# ::snt Ann Coulter on Gab (1:07-1:57): A lot of things used to seem indispensable, like buggy whips and MySpace. You're not always indispensable.
