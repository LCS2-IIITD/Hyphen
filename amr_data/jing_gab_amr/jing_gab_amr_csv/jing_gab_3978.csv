"Apparently the SPLC was just 'wishful thinking' when it tried to convince us that Matt Heimbach had forever sworn off politics...and thankfully so. Matt is now the Community Outreach Director for the National Socialist Movement, and he's working on getting his own NSM-syndicated podcast (and if you've ever listened to 'Action!,' you'd know that Matt has some podcasting chops). Since his return, Matt's only given two interviews - and I've included direct links to both of those MP3's in this post. In the YouTube clip I've attached, he discusses working With separatists and nationalists of other races to achieve common goals, the FBI's very successful WHITE HATE operation, and feds causing infighting & division within nationalist and separatist movements. Running Time: minutes, seconds. - : - ' : [[ YouTube link = ]] '!'
