"WOAH! The press is talking about his Melania-as-stripper video. But. ""Rapper T.I. was sentenced Friday to one year and a day in prison after pleading guilty to federal weapons charges after he tried to buy a stash of machine guns and silencers to protect himself after his best friend was killed."" Yes, yes, yes! When your best friend is killed, you need MACHINE GUNS and SILENCERS to protect yourself. You don't want to wake up the neighbors when mowing down assassins, and semiautomatic weapons just don't kill people dead enough. Another exemplar of leftism.","# ::snt WOAH!
