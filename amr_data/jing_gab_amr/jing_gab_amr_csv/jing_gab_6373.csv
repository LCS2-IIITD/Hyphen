"Report Finds UN Employs Pedophiles, Responsible for Rapes in Last Years A former high-level official from within the UN has blown the whistle on a pedophilia network of massive proportions involving thousands of UN employees wreaking havoc on tens of thousands of innocent children. In just ten years, under the guise of rendering aid, the United Nations has literally been raping and pillaging countries across the world. The problem has gotten so out of hand that it prompted the former UN insider, Andrew Macleod, to blow the whistle and hand over the evidence to Britains Department for International Development (DFID) Secretary Priti Patel.","# ::snt Report Finds UN Employs Pedophiles, Responsible for Rapes in Last Years A former high-level official from within the UN has blown the whistle on a pedophilia network of massive proportions involving thousands of UN employees wreaking havoc on tens of thousands of innocent children.
