"I see too many ""alt right"" types arguing against the censorship of lolicon (simulated child porn) on grounds of protecting free speech. This is how fragile they believe free speech is that in order to have it we must tolerate pedophiles ""right"" to share that filth. When I realized this I compared it to the left and their ambitions to mainstream pedophiles. So I asked myself, are these the only options? Defend pedophiles right to share child porn in order to have free speech, or tolerate pedophiles as victims of illness and allow them to share child porn? Because as both sides say, ""its not real kids?"" The argument seems to be either tolerate pedophiles or eventually lose free speech, or tolerate pedophiles because they are victims or you're a bigot. This has me wondering, does no one else see that pedophiles seem to be running both sides and are controlling or trying to control both narratives? Guess what? You can infact maintain your right to free speech and not permit pedophiles to share child porn. Anyone feeding you either of the two narratives above are pedophiles, pedophile apologists, or useful fools who have been brainwashed.","# ::snt I see too many ""alt right"" types arguing against the censorship of lolicon (simulated child porn) on grounds of protecting free speech.
