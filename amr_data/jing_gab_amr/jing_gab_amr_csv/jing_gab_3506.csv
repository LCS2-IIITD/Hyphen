"Let me tell you a story: About years ago, two armed teen-aged Dindus broke into my house while my wife and I and our child were sleeping. I got the drop on them with a shotgun. One died instantly, and the other ended up losing his right arm. I wasn't arrested, but there was a hearing. My actions were declared justifiable homicide and self defense. I found out through my lawyer that the survivor confessed that they both intended to kill whoever they found inside my house ""to see what it felt like to kill someone."" I ended up suing the parents of both of the boys for damages to my house, and won the suit. When the families wouldn't pay, I had my lawyer put liens on their houses, cars, and bank accounts. Eventually, I got paid for the door they broke, as well as fresh paint and new carpet for the living room I shot them in. To this day, my living room looks freshly painted and the carpet looks brand new. My gun saved the lives of my wife, my child, and myself. That is ALL that matters to me. That's why I have no patience for gun-grabbers and their bullshit.","# ::snt Let me tell you a story: About years ago, two armed teen-aged Dindus broke into my house while my wife and I and our child were sleeping.
