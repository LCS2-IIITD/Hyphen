"NBC News stated that President Donald Trump called Robert E. Lee incredible but Trump was actually referring to Ulysses S. Grant. President Trump first pointed out this hilarious snafu, and NBC for the record was forced to issue a retraction. Why does the mainstream media much like Antifa focus so heavily on Civil War imagery and Civil War-related controversies? Especially at a turning point moment in American history, when President Trump reports that people are coming together behind the economy? NBC also made the weeks second most-egregious blonder, with MSNBC host Katy Tur getting the name of the Florida Republican candidate for governor Ron DeSantis wrong six times. CORRECTION: An earlier tweet misidentified the general President Trump described as ""incredible"" at a rally in Ohio. It was Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, not Gen. Robert E. Lee. An attached video clip lacked the full context for Trump's remark. Here is the full clip.","# ::snt NBC News stated that President Donald Trump called Robert E.
