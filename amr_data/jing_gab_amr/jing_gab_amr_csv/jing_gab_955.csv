"I know conservatives are just ""owning the insult"" but what is ""deplorable"" about being a stable and good human being? What's so ""radical"" about it? I bet most of you aren't even racist or want the coming civil war... I feel bad for you good people caught in the middle of the shitstorm. Your generosity has been taken advantage of for far too long.","# ::snt I know conservatives are just ""owning the insult"" but what is ""deplorable"" about being a stable and good human being?
