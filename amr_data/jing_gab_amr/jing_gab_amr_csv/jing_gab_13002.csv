"Don't let Kavanaugh's victory make you relax or go soft. We are winning, for now, BUT they are raising an an army of brainwashed children of illegal immigrants, so-called refugees, minorities and suburban white kids. They are using our public school system to do it, our tax dollars, and when these kids hit their early adult years, they don't mince words....this case point, a group dedicated to sabotaging ""Christian supremacy."" What do you think that means? It starts with deplatforming, banning and fake rape accusations but the next step is extreme violence. Watch how, in this video, they speak calmly a measured at first but end with yelling ""sabotage Christian supremacy!!!""","# ::snt Don't let Kavanaugh's victory make you relax or go soft.
