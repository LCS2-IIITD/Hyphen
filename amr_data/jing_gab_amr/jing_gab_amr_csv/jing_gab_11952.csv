"The best part about Kavanaugh being confirmed is we can stop fucking hearing about it. The ONLY story of the past two weeks! It does however, make me wonder, what was the left hand doing while we were focused on the right hand? This is why I almost never follow the news, it is mostly a distraction from the much deeper, more meaningful truths. The (((media))) doesn't want you to probe into those truths so they keep you distracted with the bread and circuses. Politics as we know it, is quite literally political theater. Case in point, our POTUS was a reality TV show host. Keep in mind that those in control understand that Republicans will be in favor of anything that the Left opposes, do you really think we aren't being manipulated? I consider the Kavanaugh thing a win, but only from a propaganda perspective. Normal people are beginning to realize that the Left is a cult of lunatics, which is good for us, but only if we can steer them in a better direction. The Right is full of cultists too (looking at you ) and we would be wise to not fall for the okie-doke. Chances are Kavanaugh is just another normie Conservative pro-Israel type, plus he's a Catholic, which is a huge red flag. Stay focused on the ball guys, we need a wall, we need the State Dept and all other state and federal orgs purged of all these anti-White card carrying Marxists, we need mass deportations, we need to take down Big Social, we need to build businesses for our guys, we need to rebuild our nation from the ground up starting at the family level, then the neighborhood level, then the town level, then the national. Not to mention the epidemic levels of mental illness across all races, genders, socio-economic classes and political affiliations. There is way too much going on and far too much that we still have left to do for the entire news cycle to be Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh all day long. And I for one, will be happy to not have to hear about it any more","# ::snt The best part about Kavanaugh being confirmed is we can stop fucking hearing about it.
