I just listened to Billy Idols autobiography on audio book. It was really good. He is very smart and humble. I saw him live last year with Morrissey and he looks amazing and still has the pipes. Great energy as well. I was very impressed. Better stage presence then Morrissey.,"# ::snt I just listened to Billy Idols autobiography on audio book. It was really good. He is very smart and humble.
