"Old Yella Stripeski- No Brains, No Brass, No Balls. No ""Yes"" vote today. What is she good for, Alaska? These are times when we need bold, decisive, rational, thoughtfulaction from our elected officials. Americans are waking up. I think there may now be a chance of salvaging this country from the throes of apathy, hedonism, neglect, and cowardly tolerance, that we've experienced for the last twenty years. Alaskan Voters: Fire this twat.","# ::snt Old Yella Stripeski- No Brains, No Brass, No Balls. No ""Yes"" vote today. What is she good for, Alaska?
