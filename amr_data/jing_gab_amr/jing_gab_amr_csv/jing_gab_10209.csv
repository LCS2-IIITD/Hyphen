"Locusts: Hero shop owner fights off London youths with baseball bat This is the shocking moment up to rampaging youths swarmed like locusts into a supermarket, as terrified staff scrambled to fend them off with a baseball bat. Scores of young men spilled out of a house party and caused mayhem on the streets of Crouch Hill. Witnesses said they set off fireworks by a petrol station, threw missiles at cars, pushed a moped rider off his bike and hurled eggs and paint at passers-by before storming the shop. Footage captured on the Budget Supermarkets CCTV shows the gang rush inside and clear the shelves of sweets before being chased out by staff, one of whom grabbed a bat from under the counter. Officers called in the Met helicopter, which kept watch as the crowd quickly dispersed. Shop owner Hawar Bakhtear, , who can be seen running at the mass of youths with a baseball bat, suffered a deep cut to his hand after one attacker threw a bottle. He said: They were like locusts, there were so many of them. The only thing I could do was protect my staff. I didnt care about the stuff they were taking. It was very scary and they need to be punished; if the police dont react they will do it all over again.","# ::snt Locusts: Hero shop owner fights off London youths with baseball bat This is the shocking moment up to rampaging youths swarmed like locusts into a supermarket, as terrified staff scrambled to fend them off with a baseball bat.
