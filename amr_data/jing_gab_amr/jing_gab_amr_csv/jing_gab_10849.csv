"have to disagree about Anime with wee lassies being aimed primarily at teen school boys. Ive never met a teen lad who didnt dream of large breasted women. Conversely, i dont know how many men who wanted to date me because i looked when i was . And they always wanted the schoolgirl outfit. I think its fairly obviously aimed at the older adult males with wee willies that want someone young and inexperienced because they themselves never emotionally grew beyond primary school. Just my thoughts.","# ::snt have to disagree about Anime with wee lassies being aimed primarily at teen school boys. Ive never met a teen lad who didnt dream of large breasted women.
