"My wife takes a lot of guff here for her genuine expression of her Christian faith, a faith I share. We are both well aware of the subversion within the Church, and as devout people, we are incensed at how external actors have perverted the message. The people who attack the Church fail to realize it, far more than anything else, was what kept the threat of invasion at bay, and it's subversion has played an enormous role in our current degradation. I don't expect everyone to share our faith. I purposely do not talk often about my own beliefs because I'm not here for that purpose, and I respect people who disagree whose views do not threaten our civilization. All that said, as a husband, I would simply ask if you disagree with her, then let it be. I know social media deliberately encourages people to be our worst selves, but to the white nationalists who like to pick at her, please realize that if the efforts she makes to bridge these gaps succeed, we may all yet benefit. And I will do the same. Many Pagans know and respect me because we meet on grounds that allow for mutual respect. As we do that, we become better people, and it's not about surrendering your beliefs, white knighting, or cucking, but rather about alliances to be built against common enemies.","# ::snt My wife takes a lot of guff here for her genuine expression of her Christian faith, a faith I share.
