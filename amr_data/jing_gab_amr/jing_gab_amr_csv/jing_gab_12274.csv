"Fam...when you call someone an NPC just for disagreeing with you or liking things you don't like...that's very NPC like behavior. Aka,it's dehumanizing someone for not ""falling in line"". And if you think only the left is guilty of it you're wrong. They're the worst offenders right now but give it time,that can easily change.","# ::snt Fam...when you call someone an NPC just for disagreeing with you or liking things you don't like...that's very NPC like behavior.
