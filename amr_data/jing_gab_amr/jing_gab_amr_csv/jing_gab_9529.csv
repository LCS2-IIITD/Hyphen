Now then Tev. You see this wife beating business? Had it out with another left wing twat on Twitter the other day. Tommy was prosecuted for assaulting a cop who got in the way of a verbal dispute he had with his wife. She confirms he didn't hit her. Why he wasn't charged with domestic abuse at all. She was also in the BNP. The stories of his wife beating are all fake rumours put about by the Left with no evidence whatsoever. Are you a socialist Tev? Why do you believe socialist lies Tev?,"# ::snt Now then Tev. You see this wife beating business? Had it out with another left wing twat on Twitter the other day.
