"I got rear-ended by a careless driver who was going way over the speed limit on Friday night on way down to San Diego. I have to take it easy on J-walks until two weeks pass, as I received a concussion from the whiplash, and any blows to the head like I received during Olympia Jwalk right now might do me in. I think I will have to have my left shoulder repaired again; it feels like it tore again when I got pushed against the seat belt, and I need an MRI. I got a CT scan of head, and concussion didn't cause any bleeds in the head, thankfully. Heading back up to San Francisco Bay Area in a few days. I will be taking it easy and sitting down at desktop coordinating the edits for five to eight new this week.","# ::snt I got rear-ended by a careless driver who was going way over the speed limit on Friday night on way down to San Diego.
