"Just about the time I think that she can't get any dumber, she opens her mouth again and proves me wrong. What this means is they want to do away with the electoral college and go to straight on mob rule by direct vote based on how the elite herd them. It would literally be one of the quickest ways to the end of the USA, because it would thereby pay even more than it already does to invade the USA with third world savages that then produce children at exponential levels and then have them vote for ever greater benefits and comforts in a direct or popular vote. I would not underestimate their ability to whip up the ignorant masses that are herded by the elite to achieve just that, the ending of the indirect vote. Just look at it now, the Census counts illegals, which we now know is at least million, or the almost million I have come up with, who thereby dont just essentially get an electoral college vote for president, they also get representation in the house while American citizens and states are deprived of their votes and Representatives that would have gone to them.","# ::snt Just about the time I think that she can't get any dumber, she opens her mouth again and proves me wrong.
