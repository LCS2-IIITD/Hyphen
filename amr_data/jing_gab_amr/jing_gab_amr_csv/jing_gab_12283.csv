"I'm not sure if Trump will, he was friends with the Clintons in the past. He would be investigating the whole DNC if he wanted to clear ""the swamp"".

There is nothing like this is recent history, unless we want to look at communist Russia, maybe Venezuela.","# ::snt I'm not sure if Trump will, he was friends with the Clintons in the past.
