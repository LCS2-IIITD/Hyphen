"Yeah there are a few people that I like using it to communicate with so i understand. But I am hoping to take their users from them. I noticed even the non whites are getting banned for shit cause they do nigger shit & get ban for it on Live all the time. FB is pissing everyone off & i wanna be there to tell people theres another alternative. Then when they get here, Theyre on our turf.
