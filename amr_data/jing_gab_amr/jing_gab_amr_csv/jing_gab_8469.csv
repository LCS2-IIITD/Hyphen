"About six years ago a group of Somalis in Minnesota were convicted in a grooming gang case there. When it went to appeal they were released, because the judge refused to believe the testimony of the victim. This is what happens when the army of state employees and the journalists in Europe lie about what is going on here. Until your judges understand that this is a problem that goes hand in hand with Islam, more American girls will suffer. The publisher of Easy Meat is American. She thought sales there would outstrip sales in the UK. I told her I thought she was wrong. My expectation proved correct.","# ::snt About six years ago a group of Somalis in Minnesota were convicted in a grooming gang case there.
