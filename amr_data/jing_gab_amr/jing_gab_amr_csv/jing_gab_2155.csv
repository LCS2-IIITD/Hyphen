"This story is bullshit. This guy has gone to multiple rallies just to strategically placed himself for propaganda. In between rallies he's tried to change his appearance, intentionally, by cutting and dying his hair. We've found him, the people he is with, and their network of intentionally pushing this to make everything look organic. Btw, this is the same guy with the Q shirt that Trump pointed at. He was screaming like a maniac to get Trumps attention. This from his own account. But It was pushed as Trump just noticing the Q shirt and acknowledging it. So I have and the people that helped him.","# ::snt This story is bullshit. This guy has gone to multiple rallies just to strategically placed himself for propaganda.
