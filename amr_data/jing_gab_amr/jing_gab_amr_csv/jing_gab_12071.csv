"Twitter put me on my last suspension months ago and I told them to deactivate my account. I got a message someone signed into my account. I went back in accessed my account and changed my password to be safe. I than went into deactivate my account but because they suspended me from using my account I cant deactivate. There is no one to access. Their help section is a fucking retarded joke. I presume they do this to suspended people can not ever leave. Im going to talk to an attorney about this convoluting situation. Has anyone else been lockout of Twitter had similar situation. Jack the Dork, CEO is a menace to freedom and continues to use banned users data for profit.","# ::snt Twitter put me on my last suspension months ago and I told them to deactivate my account.
