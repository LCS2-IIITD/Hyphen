"All right: I need to explain something. People are asking me to contact Roseanne Barr for them. No. Absolutely not. For one thing, I wouldn't do that to her. BUT. For another thing, that's not the nature of our relationship. She's in the driver's seat, which is the way it has to be. I don't pick up the phone and say, ""Hey! Let's jabber!"" We're friends, but it's a friendship based on ideas. And she's the one who is in control of the contact. She first contacted me, and that's the way we've kept it. Roseanne is under pressures that most of us can't comprehend, so my role is to be there for her instead of adding to her burdens. I don't want anything from Roseanne. When we finally met in person, I felt very relaxed. It was as if we'd already met and known each other for years and years. But I never lose track of the FACT that it's a privilege to know her. A privilege is something that is offered. I'm not ENTITLED to a thing. When Roseanne calls, we talk. But I don't call her. It's just not what we do. When we met in person for the first time, she had over messages on her phone. That was from a period of maybe minutes. So I don't call her, and I will not pass on any requests from strangers. I'm not going to do anything that has even the remotest possibility of causing trouble for Roseanne. She's the boss. A nice boss. But the boss. That's a decision I made so that she would never have to worry about me betraying her. As I said, it's just the way things have to be.","# ::snt All right: I need to explain something.
