"Gab keeps going down today. We are under attack. If Deep State or Big Pedo Tech takes Gab down completely, I want court action. It's an attack on our rights & freedoms. It is persecution of people who won't shut up & obey the psycho order. No consistency here. Twitter is allowed to be a haven for pedos & Leftists inciting violence, assassinations etc.","# ::snt Gab keeps going down today. We are under attack.
