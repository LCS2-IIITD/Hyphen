"Fact: You can have the best weather report show in the world, but it won't make any difference to what the weather does. The same is true of Beltway politics.

How would accuracy in predicting how Trump will betray us ever help?","# ::snt Fact: You can have the best weather report show in the world, but it won't make any difference to what the weather does.
