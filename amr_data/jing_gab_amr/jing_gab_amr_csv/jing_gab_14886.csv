"Disingenuous meme What is your evidence that is a jew? EDIT - Jason informed me that he wasn't in occupy, it's just a myth. His being a supporter of Occupy has long been known. Occupy started out as an anti-globalist, anti-military industrial complex movement, hey just like Trump said he was. It was also anti-banker. Then just like with what happened to the Tea Party Movement, Occupy was infiltrated by professional crazies and traitors and destroyed. Next, the ACLU support free speech and did so to assist UTR. Now to the implication of the meme, to 'scare' people because Kessler was a lefty. Who cares. lots of our people started out on the left, before they grew up a little and dropped the utopian love fest values that infest our teen years and our twenties. It's part of growing up (unless you're a sociopath to begin with, or aren't very political and grew up in a right wing family). Once you get older, you realise that there is no left and right, there is only Wrong and White. My guess is that the person that created this meme is an anti-white trying to cause pointless infighting and dissension, because Kessler seems to be a doer.","# ::snt Disingenuous meme What is your evidence that is a jew?
