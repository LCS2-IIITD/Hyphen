"White Nationalist movement set back decades by this hateful act. Anyone who admires this is not interested in solutions to what we face. We are now painted as hateful people now more than ever. So those of you among us who continue to spout hatred towards all Jews should be very proud of yourselves for destroying the work of those of us who sought to bring understanding of the injustices directed at European people by Communists seeking to dominate a world without Western culture or European people. The damage is done and the price will now be paid. We will all suffer now, more than ever. Nothing to celebrate here.
