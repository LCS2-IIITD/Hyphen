"That is a fair concern. However, I am a hillbilly stuck in Denver. Everytime I hear one of these harpies try to to act like we are evil men because we are white and straight, I feel like reminding them just how dangerous we really are. How easy would it be for you and your buddies to leave many leftist hats on the ground? I know it would not be a challenge on my end.","# ::snt That is a fair concern.
