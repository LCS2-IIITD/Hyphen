Trump got under her skin so bad that she went out and got a DNA test. Warren felt the need to prove him wrong and now she looks stupid. Now you have that meme going around that says its okay to be White. It won't hurt her tho long term. The only one who would ever use it against her would be Trump. No other republican will use it - that wouldn't be polite.,"# ::snt Trump got under her skin so bad that she went out and got a DNA test.

Liz Warren is a classic example of a woman who is book smart but not people smart. A redneck could have told her it was a bad idea to publicize the results from that DNA test.
