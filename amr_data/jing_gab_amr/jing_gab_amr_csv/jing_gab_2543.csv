Conor's corner man & wrestling coach go lippy. Security tried to stop khabib climb over the octagon but was a over weigh + year. Khabib jumped off the apron of the octagon into Dillon Danus but security appeared promptly. Meanwhile the Russia corner are now inside the octagon about to scale they fence to help Khabib. Security stop them. Conors still inside. So they just go up to him & start lighting him up. Three of them were arrested. Police ask Conor if he wants to press charges. He said no. So they let them go. The Nevada athletic commission is withholding Khabib's million purse. Dana & the UFC will withhold his PPV money He's got the belt & his legacy - at the press conference Khabib said when he gets back to Dagestan his father will smash & President Putin called him to say congratulation,"# ::snt Conor's corner man & wrestling coach go lippy.
