With the shadow banning of conservatives on Twitter I decided to try this site. I am fed up with the news and want to find out what is really going on in this great country of ours. I am a Trump fan and he is the best president that we have had since Reagan and he may become the best ever. I hope to meet some great patriots on this site as well.,"# ::snt With the shadow banning of conservatives on Twitter I decided to try this site.
