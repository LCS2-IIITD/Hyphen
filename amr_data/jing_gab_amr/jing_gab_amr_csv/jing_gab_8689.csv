Music has always played a major role in influencing the minds of our children, no style of music has had as big of a negative effect as ""hip-hop"". The message in the music is as low and disgusting as it gets, and of course, it is very liberal....","# ::snt Snoop Dogg Calls Kanye West an Uncle Tom for Supporting America First Agenda Here is another piece of shit that deserves the noose.
