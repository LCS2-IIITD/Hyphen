"Their ""in house"" ethics investigations all end in either nothing or a dirty look across the aisle. I want to see some jail time and some impeachments. They say they want impeachments? I say we do the same until every rat is GONE and JAILED! Conducting business as an elected official implies honesty. If you lie or mislead, it's a felony!","# ::snt Their ""in house"" ethics investigations all end in either nothing or a dirty look across the aisle.
