"Amazing what happens when our side actually tries to win. We won't win every fight this way, but we were losing every fight by not even fighting. Our enemy isn't fifty feet tall with unbreakable armor and doesn't crap lightning bolts. They can be made to bleed. And now everybody on our side knows it. Trump is teaching the Republicans how to win. Promise kept.","# ::snt Amazing what happens when our side actually tries to win.
