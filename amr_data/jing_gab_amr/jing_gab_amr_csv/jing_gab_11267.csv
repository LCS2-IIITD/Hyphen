"I wish there was some kind of database for feminist women... then men could stop doing everything for them Need electricity? Sorry, bitch- that's made by the patriarchy. Like to have food to eat? Sucks that it's mainly produced & hauled by the patriarchy... be a strong woman & hunt & grow your own. Clean water? Oh man... looks like the patriarchy has a big hand in that too. There's always rain water collection. Empowered!","# ::snt I wish there was some kind of database for feminist women... then men could stop doing everything for them Need electricity?
