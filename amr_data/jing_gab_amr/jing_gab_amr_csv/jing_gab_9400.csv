"A grand jury indicted Leticia Sanchez, Leticia Sanchez Tepichin, Maria Solis and Laura Parra on Wednesday. Paxtons office said the women harvested votes, by filling out applications for mail-in ballots, with forged signatures. Then they would either assist the voter with filling out the ballot, or fill it out themselves, and use deception to get the voter to sign the envelope the ballot would be sent back in. Political consultant Aaron Harris said Friday the case stemmed out of information he provided to investigators back in . The harvesters sit around and fill these out by the hundreds, often by the thousands, he said Friday.","# ::snt A grand jury indicted Leticia Sanchez, Leticia Sanchez Tepichin, Maria Solis and Laura Parra on Wednesday.
