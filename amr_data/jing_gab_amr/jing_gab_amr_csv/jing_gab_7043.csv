"Most people aren't even spiritually inclined and aren't interested in history except to support whatever ideology they've been brainwashed in. Most Christians don't have an understanding of their own theology or its implications, let alone the history of the church. The masses need to be shocked or shaken before considering anything outside their small-minded realities. I see the various racially-aware groups as part of the chaotic resurgence of our Folk: in the current age, clarity is not yet expected. We never know which cognitive dissonance or shock tactic will awaken a somnambulant zombie from their slumber. We are all doing our part, in the manner we're most adept, for the audience we know best. The racial awakening is essential, and is also somewhat easier than the spiritual, which by its nature is not well suited to mere words. Yet the spiritual is vitally important. The time will come.","# ::snt Most people aren't even spiritually inclined and aren't interested in history except to support whatever ideology they've been brainwashed in.
