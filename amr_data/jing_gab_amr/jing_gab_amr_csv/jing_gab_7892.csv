"There are specific categories of white youth that are alienated by the system. Certainly this cohort will grow over time. The problem is that by the time this sense of alienation is fully manifested we may not have the numbers to effect the necessary change. Even if balkanization happens and we concentrate into a specific area where we are sovereign, the enemy will still have its bolthole in the middle east and the enemy will surround us with hostile forces. We need a sense of urgency, and we've got to ditch Trump who has turned out to be the Great Deceiver.","# ::snt There are specific categories of white youth that are alienated by the system.
