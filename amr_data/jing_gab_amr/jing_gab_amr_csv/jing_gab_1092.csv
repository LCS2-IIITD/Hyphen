"Three-Quarters of Calais Migrants Mentally Ill Report Activist health professionals have sounded the alarm over the situation in Calais, where Doctors of the World claim three-quarters of the migrants living in the hope of breaking into Britain are suffering from mental illness. France Culture said the northern port town was facing a public health emergency, in a report Wednesday which marked two years since the dismantling of the so-called Jungle camp saw almost migrants moved to asylum centres scattered across the country. Despite ongoing efforts by authorities to clear the area of illegal immigrants, whose desperate and violent attempts to reach the UK have resulted in thedeathof at least one driver and the wounding of several police officers, between to would-be illegal migrants are still living in Calais, the public broadcasterreports. Doctors of the World, whose volunteers hold regular mobile clinics for illegal immigrants in the areas of France in which they congregate, estimated that three in four of those in Calais and the who lived at the Dunkirk-based Grande-Synthe camp which wasdismantledTuesday suffer from serious mental health problems. A report by the open borders-backing NGO and Frances Primo Levi Centre revealed the most common conditions amongst immigrants residing illegally in the EU nation were psycho-traumatic syndromes, constituting percent of mental conditions diagnosed between and . In addition to having suffered extremely painful circumstances in their homelands, and experienced traumatic events in the course of migrating to Europe, the mental health of asylum seekers is degraded further still upon their arrival in France, where problems are worsened as they face rejection and authorities questioning their word with regards to the hardships they have faced, according to the report. Memory and concentration loss affecting illegal immigrants ability to recount their journey to France and the reasons they are seeking asylum is cited as a disabling psycho-traumatic symptom in the report, which claims the demands of the asylum registration process increases [migrants] suffering. The violence to which exiles have been exposed, themselves or as witnesses, has long-term effects, not only on them but also on future generations, asserts the report, claiming migrants are often suffering from the transgenerational effects of psychotrauma. To this end, the NGOs recommended that authorities take into account the degraded mental state and the extreme vulnerability of illegal immigrants in the context of narratives for the right to protection, especially when assessing the claims of unaccompanied children and adolescents. In order to solve the public health emergency of mental illness rates amongst the illegal immigrant population in France, the state should provide immediate and unconditional shelter to asylum seekers along with full entitlement to healthcare, according to the document, which neglects to examine the effect such measures would have on the number of people choosing to embark on the dangerous journey to Europe.
