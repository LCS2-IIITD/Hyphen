"What I am saying is if the only people Trump is going to nominated is going to be like Kavanaugh, then we don't have a dog in this fight, right? What is the point of movement support for a neoconservative? I was happy to support Kavanaugh against false accusations, but I definitely don't like his judicial record, and his record should exclude him from consideration in a normal country. If the government goes to the Supreme Court for an endorsement of torturing ""racists"" or seeking to designate racists as ""terorists"", how do you think Kavanaugh will rule based on his previous record? Rhetorical question because I think we both know the answer. This is how desperate ""the movement"" is for any victory. Even horrible neoconservatives being deployed by the establishment to SCOTUS is considered a victory. Its very sad indeed.","# ::snt What I am saying is if the only people Trump is going to nominated is going to be like Kavanaugh, then we don't have a dog in this fight, right?
