"OK Folks, Jewish people were just killed at a synagogue. All bets are off. There is going to be a huge push for censorship of ""hate speech"" now. It's time to stand your ground.

Speak forever free.","# ::snt OK Folks, Jewish people were just killed at a synagogue. All bets are off. There is going to be a huge push for censorship of ""hate speech"" now.
