"Trump strikes again! He can do this any time he wants. ""Fox News anchor Chris Wallace is pushing back on President Trump's claim that Democrats are responsible for thousands of migrants headed toward the United States's southern border, calling it 'preposterous.' ""Wallace appeared on Fox News's 'Americas Newsroom' on Friday to fact-checkthe claim, whichthe president made during a campaign-style rally in Montana the previous night. 'The idea that the Democrats were somehow behind this caravan coming from Honduras of these women and children is preposterous,' Wallace said on the program."" So Trump gets the NATIONAL MEDIA to alert the public that another caravan is on the way, and Trump gets the national media to talk about the notion that the Democrats are behind it. Perfect. Another tiger pit dug, and the Democrats fall right into it. The voters are thinking, ""Why is the caravan coming NOW, and why is everyone telling us that we have to accept this invasion?"" It pisses off the voters. As always, the press is Trump's most effective ally.","# ::snt Trump strikes again! He can do this any time he wants.
