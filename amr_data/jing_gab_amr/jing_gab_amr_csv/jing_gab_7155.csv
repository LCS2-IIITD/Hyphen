"Gab.com Statement on US Obscenity Law, Free Expression, and Loli Hentai The poem Howl was nearly censored under obscenity laws in . If you read it, youll note that it truely is a remarkable work of poetry. In other words, it has artistic value in relation to the Miller Test, the three-prong obscenity test that is the United States Supreme Court's test for determining whether speech or expression can be labeled obscene. The question of what is obscene and what is not is one of vigorous legal debate. Similar in nature to hate speech, the word obscene can be subjective in nature. The difference is obscenity laws have decades of legal precedent from SCOTUS, whereas hate speech was unanimously ruled as first amendment protected speech by SCOTUS in Matal v Tam (2016.) Another prominent obscenity test is the Stewart Standard from Jacobellis v. Ohio, U.S. (1964) on what constitutes pornography and obscene content. This has been cited in Gabs user guidelines since January nd . The Stewart Standard, more popularly described as I know it when I see it, is one of the most known Supreme Court phrases in history. It is a colloquial expression by which a speaker attempts to categorize an observable fact or event, although the category is subjective or lacks clearly defined parameters. Now the difference between the poem Howl and hentai loli cartoons depicting babies, toddlers, and young children being sexually abused is ultimately all about visual obscenity. You can look at a poem, but not know how to read it. Say Howl was written in some bizarre alien language that no human knew. Would you say it was obscene? Certainly not. If the poem was read in different languages that you did not speak, would you find it obscene? Of course not. Even if you find the poem extremely offensive, have those words seared an image in your brain that can not be unseen? The same can not be said for loli hentai images that specifically depict what are very obviously infants and young children being sexually abused. The problem with the term loli is that it is very broad. It means different things to different cultures and groups of people. That is why we very specifically describe what we are referring to. You can show that content to anyone of any language from any background at any time in history and they would have an instant reaction. That reaction would be overwhelming negative and very few if any would find artistic value in the content. While porn itself would evoke a similar reaction, when the content in question very obviously depicts babies, toddlers, and very young children: under the Miller Test and the Steward Standard it would likely be deemed obscene by SCOTUS and most certainly by the average person. Multiple US states agree that it is indeed obscene and illegal. Under federal law USC A loli hentai is a legal grey area. Gabs policy is to follow all applicable laws in The United States of America, the Constitution and the Supreme Courts rulings on the First Amendment. We use the Courts rulings, precedents and judgments as our guiding principles for protecting and empowering free speech and expression. This is why we do not allow loli hentai images that specifically depict what are very obviously infants, babies, toddlers, and young children being sexually abused.","# ::snt Gab.com Statement on US Obscenity Law, Free Expression, and Loli Hentai The poem Howl was nearly censored under obscenity laws in .
