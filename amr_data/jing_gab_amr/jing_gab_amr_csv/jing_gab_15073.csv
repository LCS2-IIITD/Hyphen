"I'm not going to say much about this, except to report the gist of what happened. One of my female relatives lives alone with her daughter in a large city in FL. Her daughter works, and was away at work when this happened. My relative went out to her garden late yesterday morning, came back inside and didn't lock the door behind her, and so was followed into the house by a vibrant individual. Shortly after the event, she called my dad, who told her to call and he'd be over. (Not unusual for people in my family to call either my dad or I in preference to .) An ambulance took her to the hospital for the standard rape kit and also treatment of multiple lacerations because it took place in the bathroom and glass items/shower door/mirror were broken as she struggled. While she was in the hospital, crime scene investigators went over her house and removed several items for fingerprint/DNA analysis etc. For undisclosed reasons, this particular relative cannot be armed, though her daughter is. But her daughter wasn't home. The last thing she needed was the event of yesterday. My Dad is there now taking care of things and making sure she is okay. It's likely I'll disappear for a couple of days in the near future just to help out with installing some security stuff etc. When I disappear, my phones etc don't come with me. If I don't answer texts, calls or email, don't be concerned -- I'll get to it when I get back. Family first!","# ::snt I'm not going to say much about this, except to report the gist of what happened. One of my female relatives lives alone with her daughter in a large city in FL.
