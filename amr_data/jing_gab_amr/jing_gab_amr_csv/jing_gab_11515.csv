"I think we should start arresting these leftist mob protestors who destroy property, intimidate people, scream at the sky and otherwise disrupt daily business and admitting them into mental institutions where they belong. This is not normal behavior. This is not protesting. This is not near normal behavior. These people are mostly all college age kids who have been indoctrinated by a leftist ideology hellbent on dismantling the rule of law, the rule of ethics and the rule of respect in our country. These people are of no use to society, and they don't appear capable of contributing to society at all. They need to be diagnosed and treated in a facility by professionals trained to deal with their behavior. This is not a joke, I'm not blowing smoke. These people are a danger to society and to themselves if they aren't treated. The next order of action should be to either discredit these liberal indoctrination camps or put people in place who can teach a curriculum worthy of calling themselves institutions of higher learning. It may take a generation, but it'll be worth every ounce of effort in the long run.","# ::snt I think we should start arresting these leftist mob protestors who destroy property, intimidate people, scream at the sky and otherwise disrupt daily business and admitting them into mental institutions where they belong.
