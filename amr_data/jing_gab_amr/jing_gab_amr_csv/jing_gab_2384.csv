"The fact that the Republican Party has a habit of working against the interests of White nationalists, is not sufficient to justify abandonment of the party, at least not without a clear alternative. It matters who controls the government, a lot. Democrats are using every power at their disposal to establish a permanent governing majority in Washington. They will open the borders, and nationalize one industry after another until something forces them to stop. They will disarm us, tax carbon dioxide, and make Facebook's hate speech policies the law of the land. Whatever the sins of the GOP, they pale in comparison to that horrifying outcome. Until somebody shows me some other force which is capable of stopping the Democrat Party, we have to be partisan Republicans.","# ::snt The fact that the Republican Party has a habit of working against the interests of White nationalists, is not sufficient to justify abandonment of the party, at least not without a clear alternative.
