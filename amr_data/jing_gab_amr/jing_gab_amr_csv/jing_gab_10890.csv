Spent a lot of time this week at ROF Burghfield (where we clean the Deuterium off our Nuclear Warheads and re-pack the UHE that sets the damned things off) According to the spasticated Lawyer Daggett that is Mark Lewis and the equally (but differently) spasticated Slatfascists they should have arrested me! But as I keep telling them... they are chasing a zephyr... they have every single thing wrong. Thats the funniest bit... overall.,"# ::snt Spent a lot of time this week at ROF Burghfield (where we clean the Deuterium off our Nuclear Warheads and re-pack the UHE that sets the damned things off) According to the spasticated Lawyer Daggett that is Mark Lewis and the equally (but differently) spasticated Slatfascists they should have arrested me!
