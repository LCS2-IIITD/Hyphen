Now, he's running around acting like he's in danger. His job puts him close to Trump. Could this emotional, malicious & damaged man decide to ""act"" on these perceived threats? He should be kept away.","# ::snt Jim Acosta is acting very emotional & he's extremely fixated on Trump. Jim's proven he's willing to say things that he knows are false in order to hurt him.
