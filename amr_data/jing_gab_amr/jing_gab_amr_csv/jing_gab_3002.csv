Funny how you claimed my calls for genociding your whole race and shoving you specifically into a woodchipper (both of which I'm still very much in favor of) were against the TOS and that I'd surely be suspended for them and yet here I am still standing and there you are on a new account lmao,"# ::snt Funny how you claimed my calls for genociding your whole race and shoving you specifically into a woodchipper (both of which I'm still very much in favor of) were against the TOS and that I'd surely be suspended for them and yet here I am still standing and there you are on a new account lmao
