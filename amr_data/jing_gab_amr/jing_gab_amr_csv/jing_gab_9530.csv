"Do you think criminlization is good? Let the anti whites talk their shite. Only the people united can enforce culture. Police are merely statisticians of crime. They hardly solve crime, they couldnt never enforce it. It would also open the door to make the state or city ""ungovernable"" by overloading courts and police even more.","# ::snt Do you think criminlization is good? Let the anti whites talk their shite.
