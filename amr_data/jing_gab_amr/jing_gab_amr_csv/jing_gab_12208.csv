"Another day, another ridiculous controversy on gab. I can't believe I'm about to type all this shit out from a phone, but here it goes... Flat chested is a reasonable fetish. Hairless is a reasonable fetish. I can get how people are into that, and I was a flat fan for a long time. Tastes change /shrug/. I'm a firm believer that if a crime hasn't been committed, who cares. Moral absolutism isn't for me, except on very serious issues. Beating your meat to anime representations of little girls isn't a serious issue. That said, itdoes go a little beyond fetishizing the flat chest or the hairless crotch. The loli I've seen has baby fat and other physical traits that are undoubtedly child-like. It doesn't get me going, but neither do feet and I don't question those weirdos, so I'm not going to tell anyone to kick their loli fetish because I don't get it. (footfags are gross by the way, fucking kill yourselves). I'm not a psychologist so I can't say if a person stroking their cock to loli is a pedo at heart or just makes a fetish out of ruining innocence or something similar. I'd actually be interested to know how many pedos are behind bars or otherwise convicted as such that had loli - not child porn - on their phones, computers, etc (in addition to the child porn, of course). I'm talking out of my ass here, but I actually think the facts would be surprising. Needless to say, there's loli threads on halfchan's /b/ at any given time. There's probably a loli board on ch and I know there's a loli board on chan. I'm not knocking your thing, but it's a bit excessive to need loli to be part of your experience on gab as well. Should it be a bannable offense on a free speech site? No, that's laughable. Is it purportedly a legal grey area? Sure. I'm not a lawyer. ,you're probably the most nightmarish PR rep since Dina over at the Mighty No. ""forum"". If you're nervous that the enemy is gonna use loli against you as a reason to deplatform gab, say it in as many words. Here's something you're going to have to learn as a creator, if you haven't learned it already: no one who uses your creation gives a shit about your personal feelings and a good % probably disagree with them. You have to separate yourself from how someone uses what you made, it's the only way to be lastingly happy. So if there's a legal reason or a strategic reason, give the masses those reasons. No one asked you to inject your philosophy on top of that. That's my two cents on the matter, if you've paid any attention to this novella. Go ahead and call me a pedo defender too, if you want.","# ::snt Another day, another ridiculous controversy on gab.
