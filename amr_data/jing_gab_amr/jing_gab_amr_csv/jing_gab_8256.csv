"Twitter BANNED me and reported me to the FBI for stating the obvious: In order for the threats of violence to stop, we're going to have to see a leftist ASSAILANT shot to pieces on live TV. Kenny tells me that this person still has her Twitter account. She's got her left leg up in the slipstream of the car so that she can air out her fetid vagina. Cheaper than soap.","# ::snt Twitter BANNED me and reported me to the FBI for stating the obvious: In order for the threats of violence to stop, we're going to have to see a leftist ASSAILANT shot to pieces on live TV.
