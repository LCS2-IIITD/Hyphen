"I don't think so, because this isn't an actual circuit court trial, although they are treating it that way... It's weird... I think they should. I also think they need to start taking rape allegations more seriously and the accuser needs to have repercussions. If I falsely accuse you of murder and I get busted lying, I'll go to jail. If I accuse you of rape, and it's found I'm lying, it's like I get an uncomfortable laugh and told not to do it again... The allegation of rape needs to be taken much more seriously, both ways, and it needs to stop being a media circus. Even when they say, Kavanaugh didn't do it -- his home life is still ruined.","# ::snt I don't think so, because this isn't an actual circuit court trial, although they are treating it that way...
