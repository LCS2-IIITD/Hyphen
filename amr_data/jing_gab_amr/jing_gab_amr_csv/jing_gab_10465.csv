"To all you moron Jew haters... You're as stupid, dangerous, and Godless as dimocrats. Your wanton unyielding ignorance shames all humanity. You are not welcome among decent educated people. I wish I could mute you all at once. My Lord Jesus IS a Jew. Stew on that. Eat it in fact. My staff will sprout while you grumble unto death. I truly feel sorry for you.","# ::snt To all you moron Jew haters... You're as stupid, dangerous, and Godless as dimocrats. Your wanton unyielding ignorance shames all humanity.
