Funny thing normal folk. There are NatSocs on here and real cultural Marxists like and But you never see them arguing with each other do you. Always with normal folk like you and me. I have a theory. NatSocs and Marxists both follow feeble socialist ideologies with fragile minds & egos. They worry that if they argue together they might start listening to the other and possibly even convert. But there's no chance they will convert to being normal like us. What do you reckon?,"# ::snt Funny thing normal folk.
