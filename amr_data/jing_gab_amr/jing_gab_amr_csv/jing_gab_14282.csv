"Bad move. He has nothing to prove to anyone. Once a month that office is going to be like Dante's Inferno. You could power an electrical station on the passive aggressiveness alone. Good grief. He should have hired all white, Christian, straight, males who like beer and who have a family to support. I hope he likes four women telling him where his couch should go. (Psst, none of them will agree on the location either), pumpkin spice latte dripped all over the briefings they type, hair clogging up his office bathroom sink, and no one who can stay late because they have to pick up little Johnny from the babysitters! Oh, AND Dems will still call him a gang rapist until the day he dies.","# ::snt Bad move. He has nothing to prove to anyone. Once a month that office is going to be like Dante's Inferno.
