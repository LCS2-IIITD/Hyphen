Well the Mossad guy didn't even mention most of that. He just said they treat wounded Syrian rebels and Al Quaeda humanely because they haven't attacked Israel. On all other issues they support the US against Al Quaeda. Said they won't look after Hezbollah terrorists due to their past actions against Israel. No mention of sending terrorists into Europe.,"# ::snt Well the Mossad guy didn't even mention most of that.
