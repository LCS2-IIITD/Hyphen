"I have figured out what the ""INSURANCE POLICY"" is! The DC Madames black book, the Verison phone records, the bank records, the emails, texts, and the Supreme Court Justice Kennedy if it's true he illegally adopted two children from Ireland, the goods on Congress, all combined the CIA, NSA, FBI, DOJ, etc...has every one in their pockets by blackmail? Proof is on the hard drives whistleblower Montgomery gave to the FBI. Larry Klayman his attorney tried to get the Congress to see his proof President Trump before elected was spied upon last year. I am posting the link to Larry Klaymans letters to Congress. More information is posted today by me from audio tapes, proof of the testimony before the FBI in a secret place, and more. Just scroll through my timeline for more proof. Why else would they not talk to him? He had the same proof they FBI, CIA, NSA had on Congress with the DC Madame, and what ever they did. He had not connected the dots, but it is the same time span as the records he had of the spying on Trump for years they paid him to do, along with many others in the sweeps so no one would know who they were targeting. If you sweep every one, there is no trail of the real target. Congress, Trump, and any one else who could run and defeat their plans to destroy America. Pdf link below. I am adding Gem Stones page link to the information she has dug posted here on Gab too, they go together to uncover the evil they are doing to us, and calling it National Security. Please help...keep researching this must be made viral and get as many deep diving putting the puzzle together. Thank you! -DevilDog","# ::snt I have figured out what the ""INSURANCE POLICY"" is!
