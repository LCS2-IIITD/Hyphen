After months of campaigning on the various Labour and Unite affiliated Facebook groups we have managed to persuade the executive of each to effectively ban jew friendly journalists from all policy and fund raising meetings. British jews are not happy about this and next week Im told there will be a push by jews in the media to highlight this move. That will be interesting as it will alienate the jew further from both enormities. Good news for antisemites across the world.,"# ::snt After months of campaigning on the various Labour and Unite affiliated Facebook groups we have managed to persuade the executive of each to effectively ban jew friendly journalists from all policy and fund raising meetings.
