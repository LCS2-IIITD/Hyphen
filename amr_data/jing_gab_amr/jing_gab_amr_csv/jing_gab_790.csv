"Anyone saying I snitched on the RAM guys is just plain lying. I literally have no idea who any of these guys are, except for what I read in the media long after my meeting with the FBI, and my body camera captured zero right wing violence. I gave the FBI video from my Walmart parking lot meetup where I was falsely accused of brandishing a firearm by Antifa, and video of the planning meeting on the evening of August th, where we discussed coordinating with law enforcement to avoid violence. In the civil case I gave up recordings of phone calls, emails, and text messages, all of which confirm what I have always said, that everybody I was involved with was trying to obey the law. If what I showed the FBI had any impact on any investigation into our side, it was wholly exculpatory to everyone on our side that I had anything to do with. Anyone who says otherwise is falsely implicating the organizers and headliners of UTR1 in a criminal conspiracy that just plain did not exist. I didn't ""snitch"" on anybody, primarily because I genuinely wasn't aware of any crimes committed by anyone I could be said to be ""snitching"" on. I reported a myriad of crimes of course, and I've spent much of the last months bitching about those crimes not being prosecuted. But I don't think it's ""snitching"" to tell the government about communist terrorism.","# ::snt Anyone saying I snitched on the RAM guys is just plain lying.
