"I dont wade into the Pagan vs Christian debate. Here is why... My main criterion in judging people is whether theyre pro-white. And I criticize all anti-whites, which includes many Christians. Right now, all pro-whites should ally together and not fight among ourselves. We have enemies who want all whites gone. After we defeat our real enemies and establish white ethno-states, then we can have the Pagan vs Christian debate.","# ::snt I dont wade into the Pagan vs Christian debate. Here is why...
