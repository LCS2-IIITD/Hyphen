"I was saddened to hear Bracken support the shut down of gab, because of the Nazi hate. Does he not understand that the majority of the Nazi trolls come directly from Media Matters? This is a classic Leftist tactic. Remember the violence at the Trump rallies, and they blamed it on Bernie? He said that since gab was privately owned, it should shut down all Nazi, Muslim, and Communist speech. WTF? Why not then shut down all Christians? How easy would it be for the enemy to put on a Christian cross and go murder people, AND WE GET BLAMED? What happened to innocent until proven guilty? I would have thought Bracken would see through all of that.","# ::snt I was saddened to hear Bracken support the shut down of gab, because of the Nazi hate.
