"From the article: I offer my sincerest regrets to the Brookhaven community for the insensitivity that portrayed during the Friday evening halftime show. There is an active investigation into the circumstances that led to this performance, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said. While I do not believe that there was a malice intent on behalf of the students that participated in this halftime show, I understand that we are ultimately not defined by the things that we set out to do, but rather how we respond to the things that actually do take place. It is the responsibility of adults to offer guidance to youth. Our students should have been instructed that this was neither the time or place for that performance. Not abject apologies; regrets The students arent seven years old, theyre in high school. They fully understood the malice in their actions. Our students should have been instructed that this was neither the time or place for that performance. Please enlighten us, Mayor: When would have been the appropriate venue to pretend to kill cops?","# ::snt From the article: I offer my sincerest regrets to the Brookhaven community for the insensitivity that portrayed during the Friday evening halftime show.
