"Y'all know I'm a southern woman with a big mouth & attitude. But let me talk to my southern ppl a minute. Y'all that live in the rural south may not see the Muslim influence in America. It's not in my town but honey, it's here. This is where we need to listen to the Yankees a bit. They have it more in their face. Other states too but I'm talkin North/South here. It's real Southerners & it's in their schools. Liberals & Muslims are running the larger City schools. All I am saying is, don't think it won't reach you if not stopped! The ""good ole boys"" need to get your guns ready. It will reach you if not stopped from growing. That's it. I'm done. Thanks.","# ::snt Y'all know I'm a southern woman with a big mouth & attitude.
