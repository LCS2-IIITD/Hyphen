"That's the favorite word of the Left, isn't it? 'Ignorant'. I'm sure you aren't ignorant to the fact that Negros have a habit of raping White women. Why should we allow these Negros access to White countries? Over and over again, they rape, they pillage and they destroy everything they touch. Why should we let them continue this, free of consequences?","# ::snt That's the favorite word of the Left, isn't it? 'Ignorant'.
