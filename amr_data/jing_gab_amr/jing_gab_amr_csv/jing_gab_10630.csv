I have a friend who considers himself a right-wing Christian. He is livid that I refuse to vote in the midterms (and has even threatened to end our friendship). His problem is that he listens to alt media filling his head with -D chess narratives. This is why I have nothing but harsh invective for the American alt-right. You assholes are leading us off a cliff.,"# ::snt I have a friend who considers himself a right-wing Christian.
