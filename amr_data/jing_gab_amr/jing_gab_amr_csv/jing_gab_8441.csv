"Orwell It was in the year that the perception deception was beginning to erode as more of the masses began to wake up to the reality of non reality of their existence. Everything that the masses have been brainwashed with was quickly coming to end. Questions were starting to have an effect on the false narrative that was being pushed ever since the slaves were born. What is real no longer seemed to be real, and reality was more of a convoluted mess as it was hard to distinguish what was real and what was fake. But was becoming apparent is the minds of the masses have been controlled which has been going on since the beginning of time. The Thought Police were in full censor mode now since they were losing control, deleting as many truths as they could and keeping their obviously lies and false narrative alive through the Ministry of Truths extensive apparatus. The inmates were still policing the inmates and any sign of intelligence was quickly frowned upon. Anyone not following this typically will just disappear, but the sheer magnitude of people waking up was a problem. In the political language the absurdities were continually pushed, but the irrational emotion of the lies were no longer taking hold against even the basics of logic, except for the true zombies who would believe even the most obnoxious lie. Truth is censored and is call hate speech, Racists brazenly called their opponents Racist, and the unconscious walked around in a deep fog doing exactly what they were told to do. The proles who understood the truth were growing and the false narrative was easily discernible! The proles were getting mad because they were throwing off the chains and could see outside Platos Cave. The Truth was no longer inextricably described as Hate, but started to be realized for the exactly what it is. The dislocation of consciousness and reality from the Matrix was taking its toll as the sane were still viewed as insane, but sanity was being restored. In general, the greater the understanding, the great the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane. The Brave New World, Platos Cave, Orwells and the Matrix, all one and the same, have been exposed!","# ::snt Orwell It was in the year that the perception deception was beginning to erode as more of the masses began to wake up to the reality of non reality of their existence.
