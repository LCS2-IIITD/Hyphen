The DailyStormer is responsible for the pro-Trump spam. Weaponizing anti-Semitism they're able to divide Jews into two groups: Liberals and Zionists. By demonizing the open-border Jews they effectively tie anti-Multiculturalism to the pro-Zionist movement. Jews create the problem only to offer their own solution. DailyStormer is MOSSAD.,"# ::snt The DailyStormer is responsible for the pro-Trump spam. Weaponizing anti-Semitism they're able to divide Jews into two groups: Liberals and Zionists.
