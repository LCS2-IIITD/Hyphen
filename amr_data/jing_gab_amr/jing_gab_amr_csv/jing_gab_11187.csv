"Hat tip Jack Dorsey desperately vomits platitudes in recognition that he's fucked. ""Our purpose today, we believe, our superpower, is around conversation. And we believe our purpose is to serve the public conversation. And that does take a stance around freedom of expression and defending freedom of expression as a fundamental human right. Not just one within this country. ""But it also comes with a realization that freedom of expression may adversely impact other fundamental human rights, such as privacy and physical security. So we believe that we can only serve the public conversation, we can only stand for freedom of expression if people feel safe to express themselves in the first place. We can only do that if they feel that they are not being silenced."" Leftists care only about words, so Jack thinks that he's talked his way out of the coming catastrophe. Here's what's going to happen: The Democrats will blame the tech moguls for the midterm bloodbath. Leftist pundits all over the country will point to Twitter's blatant double standard and scapegoat Jack for energizing conservatives. Nobody will change their behavior, so Trump will preside over at least two more Democratic electoral massacres. Jack Dorsey is not a skilled liar, and he's actually pained by what he's doing. You can see it in he's eyes. BUT HE WON'T STOP DOING IT. Last night one of the greatest musicians of all time agreed to compose an instrumental piece for me. It's going to be about hate, idiotic rage, and insanity. He's very busy, so there's no date I can give you. But he's EXTREMELY excited about the project. I hope to persuade Roseanne Barr to take part. My instinct told me to wait until the artist has the free time to do this. He said that if I went with another musician, he'd understand, but I'm going to stick with him. He's indifferent to the music world turning on him for doing a project that involves Roseanne. ""That's not a factor,"" he said. The piece WILL be composed, and a live performance WILL be videotaped and put on YouTube. So as you can see, the Jack Dorseys of the world don't matter to me. I forge ahead, and leftists continue to fail. The musician in question has had his career taken from him multiple times, so he understands Roseanne and me--even though what I lost is nothing in comparison to what Roseanne lost. A song for Jack Dorsey and ALL leftists, by Gentle Giant. Now she sits by the riverside Watching the waters glide by With a sigh And the things she put faith in Are ripples just waving her by With a sigh She sees lovers pass by With much more than a kiss Ah this little girl who had everything Finds she's nothing at all","# ::snt Hat tip Jack Dorsey desperately vomits platitudes in recognition that he's fucked.
