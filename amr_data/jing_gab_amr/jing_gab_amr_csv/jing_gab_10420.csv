Mention of the practice is buried in another entry on a ""conspiracy theory"" about journalists pushing demographic replacement.","# ::snt Years ago, the editor of the Swedish tabloid Expressen admitted to ""vitpixling""whereby criminals' dark skin in photos was lightened and pixelated, to make them appear white.
