"That's the thing with boomers. They have done this so much and so often that they can no longer see that it's this weakness that tells other races ""You can walk all over us."" And as far as we are concerned it's just another indignity we have to live with until they are dead. It's not just that I am embarrassed for them, but they embarrass me frankly. It sickens me that anyone might think that they are representative of the white man. Let alone that they seem to think they have some kind of wisdom or guidance that they should be handing us lol If you'll notice - it was kind of a meme in itself back in the 's - the old man handing down wisdom, now that ""meme"" (for want of a better word) is completely gone.
