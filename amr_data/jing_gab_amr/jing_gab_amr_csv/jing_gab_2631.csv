"I don't know enough to spin a conspiracy theory on this yet, but I gotta say, this is beginning to feel like election interference from an intelligence agency. In the fourteen months since Charlottesville there hasn't really been a major violent incident from our side, right? Then, <2 weeks before the midterms, we get the ""MAGA Bomber"" who supposedly sent fake bombs to prominent Democrats, left DNA and fingerprints all over the things, and had a van covered in Trump shit, but only followed Democrats on Twitter. Immediately after that, the ""All Jews Must Die!"" synagogue shooter, opens fire on a bunch of praying kikes without any specific provocation, then does battle with responding officers,using the Democrat's favorite firearm, the AR-15. And of course, with absolutely no plans of escaping. At this rate, we'll wake up Monday to news of an actual slave plantation kidnapping negroes and making them pick cotton manually, then throw it away, just for the joy of oppressing them. By Wednesday they'll be parading some other patsy around, claiming he was building gas chambers in his basement, with wooden doors of course, in a poorly constructed plan to carry out the final solution. By Friday we'll be hearing about a Tinder rapist who confesses to a hundred rapes in the name of ""Thot Patrol"".","# ::snt I don't know enough to spin a conspiracy theory on this yet, but I gotta say, this is beginning to feel like election interference from an intelligence agency.
