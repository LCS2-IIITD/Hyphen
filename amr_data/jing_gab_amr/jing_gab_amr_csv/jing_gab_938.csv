"Tonight Hannity said, in relation to the incivility of the Left and today's bomb scares, ""In days, we settle our differences at the ballot box"" Sorry to tell ya Sean, the Left is not going to consider anything settled on Election day. If they lose, they will continue their criminal mayhem on the street. If they win, they will use their power to continue that same mayhem in the House of Representatives. If Nancy Pelosi becomes Speaker of the House, expect assassination attempts on Trump and Pence, as they try to stick us with President Pelosi by force. These people are not playing by the rules of democracy and civil discourse. They are operating by the rules of warfare and espionage, and they have been for a long time. They will stop at nothing. They will continue to escalate without concern for repercussion, until they are stopped by force. The only hope we have of preventing a full blown civil war in this country, is for Republicans to get their heads out of their asses and prosecute the communists who are perpetrating and supporting this carnage. So long as the Justice Department is more interested in virtue signaling against racists than they are with stopping crime, crime will continue to be a regular part of our political life. Sadly, I suspect the latter is far more likely than the former.","# ::snt Tonight Hannity said, in relation to the incivility of the Left and today's bomb scares, ""In days, we settle our differences at the ballot box"" Sorry to tell ya Sean, the Left is not going to consider anything settled on Election day.
