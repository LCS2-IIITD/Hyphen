"Tommy Robinson was photographed with a group of young soldiers during a chance meeting at a motorway service station. These lads have now had their phones seized and are being ""investigated"" by the British Army who buckled under pressure from muslims. I am pretty close to breaking point - this is an outrage and it is clearly being made into an issue by our enemies. Please, if you feel angry about this or simply want to show support for our troops over the spineless middle class who can wet themselves when muslims complain.
