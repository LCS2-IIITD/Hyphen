"We do however have representatives , as all Americans. The Feminist-rat Party has been taking the real Democrats carts over the cliff for years. Hillary is apart of this gaggle. The youth follow this old wrench because they fail to study or seek fact about her and other. They just vote gender believing it will help their gender. Hillary has only harmed female gender by protecting Bill Clinton, against real assaults by this leecherous old hillbilly from Arkansas. She and he are charter members of the KKK in Arkansas. You cant fix stupid.","# ::snt We do however have representatives , as all Americans. The Feminist-rat Party has been taking the real Democrats carts over the cliff for years.
