"My friend here looks great, and it's a good reminder of how utterly irrelevant you are. Where are you in the national stage? Oh that's right! Nowhere! How many followers you bleeding these days? I keep seeing your numbers sliding! Not a surprise; pretty much everyone despises you! Why, most of your posts don't even break upvotes! Meanwhile, I get hundreds of upvotes here, and millions of hits on my site. Amazing how, even though you're ""powered"" by Adderall, you never seem to accomplish anything! Pathetic! Why, you couldn't even pull off your ""Q troll"" successfully, because literally no one believed you! Precisely ZERO converts! Not surprising coming from a ZERO like you!","# ::snt My friend here looks great, and it's a good reminder of how utterly irrelevant you are. Where are you in the national stage? Oh that's right!
