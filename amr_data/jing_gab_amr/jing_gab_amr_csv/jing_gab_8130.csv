"Ably said. Participation in mainstream politics does not preclude metapolitics. It is fine if one thinks elections can never yield positive results, but there is no sense in the self-fulfilling pessimism of keeping out. Every rightist should cast a ballot for the best candidates available in each election, and then, if that does not work, we can say we tried our best.","# ::snt Ably said.
