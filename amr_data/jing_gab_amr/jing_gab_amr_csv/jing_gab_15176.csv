"Dear Gab: In case the good folks at Twitter come over here and pull the same stunt they did over there, it's another case of stripping the context from a tweet. I posted that photo in response to death threats. Guess what? The death threats stopped. Leftists go after those who they think can't defend themselves. People were OUTRAGED that I would respond this way to threats of violence. There's a full-court press going on to get me off of all social media. Hollywood protects its own. That's fine. I just thought I'd get ahead of it. Carry on.","# ::snt Dear Gab: In case the good folks at Twitter come over here and pull the same stunt they did over there, it's another case of stripping the context from a tweet.
