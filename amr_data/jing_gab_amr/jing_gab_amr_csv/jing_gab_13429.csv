"What the hell, Aussies?! I strolled by a TV today and caught a minute or two of a snake-catching guy covered in tattoos. After he bags a snake and hands off the bag to his chunky tatted gf, he walks over and shakes hands with two AFRICAN looking cops, not Abos, but AFRICANS. Why would you let them in your country? They're a plague here in the USA.","# ::snt What the hell, Aussies?! I strolled by a TV today and caught a minute or two of a snake-catching guy covered in tattoos.
