"IIt's a bit ironic that the patriarchy allowed Jewish supremacy and before Jewish supremacy, we had no feminism. MGTOW is also ironic because it's a group of feminist men who claim to hate feminism. I really believe that a guy who blames women for the failure of the patriarchy is just a Yiddish troll. But, I kind of expected trolls, so, carry on.","# ::snt IIt's a bit ironic that the patriarchy allowed Jewish supremacy and before Jewish supremacy, we had no feminism.
