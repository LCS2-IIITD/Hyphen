"Dear God the plot holes in this story are next to amazing... First, clearly he thought everyone was going to let him get off because of handicap and minority status. Second, if you guys are planning to murder people, make multiple complaints first. Call the police, complain to neighbors and building managers, make an active attempt to squash or escalate things. Make a paper trail. Don't be Christine Ford... You are totally unbelievable when you say it's been going on for years but no one ever heard a peep before your grand entrance. Third, what the hell is wrong with this family... A paraplegic -- provided for the family? He was the ""big brother,"" when he was FOURTH of six!? Sounds closer to little disabled brother... I can see why he was pissed and wanted to kill people... Finally, you have to love it when everyone tries to paint out these football players as big teddy bears... Yeah, maybe to his little sister... I'll tell you what, I was a football player in high school and college myself... There isn't a single person that plays football that isn't suffering from some kind of anger or aggression issues. Thus, the joining of the modern American gladiatorial arena... The smell of the Earth, the roar of the crowd, the ways you can legally tear another guy's head off his shoulders without consequence (maybe yards at worst), rended flesh, broken bones, and the never ending taste of blood in your mouth... Sure, my female friends and family would say I was a teddy bear, but to any of them that was ever touched wrongly by a man in my presence, they'll also tell you that I was psychopath as well. I also more-or-less avoided the roids, although my sophomore college years I took andriosterone for a few months in off season for training -- coach was giving it out to all the guys... It was a brown fluid that tasted like dirt in a blue bottle with a Swedish label on it, gross stuff but huge energy boosts... Most do not, and steroids give you spontaneous energy enhancing most any extreme emotion you feel... Like one would get if you are some Adonis and some cripple in a wheelchair starts talking smack out of the side of his face at you in an elevator or something... My point is that there is no such thing as non-violent football players. Football players all have some kind of anger or violence issue or another and this is how they cope. They want to manhandle others for a reason -- and usually, the kindest, most gentle folks, are the most violent... The quiet humble family man next door will shoot the bejeezus out of you if you threaten his home, and he will dance on your grave, because his anger and aggression is always repressed. He probably did scare or threaten the cripple guy... He may have been a dick that deserved to be shot... The cripple guy murdered someone and deserves to go to jail for returning to a conflict he had already walked away from (no pun intended).
