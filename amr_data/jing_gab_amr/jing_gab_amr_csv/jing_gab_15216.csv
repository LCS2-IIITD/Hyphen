"It's pretty bad here in Austin - As I've mentioned here before, I don't dare put out a Cruz lawn sign, since I have cars parked outside that won't fit in the garage.

So I'll speak out publicly, but not stupidly, and VOTE to DRAIN THE SWAMP!","# ::snt It's pretty bad here in Austin - As I've mentioned here before, I don't dare put out a Cruz lawn sign, since I have cars parked outside that won't fit in the garage.
