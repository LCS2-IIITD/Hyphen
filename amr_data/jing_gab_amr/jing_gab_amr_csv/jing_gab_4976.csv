People sticking up for Dylan Roof make me sick. He should not have murdered those innocent people. They let him come to church and study the Bible with them. The fact is that he was doing Satan's work in killing Christians. Anyone doing this might as well be a Jew killing the Lord Jesus Christ and Christians who follow Him.,"# ::snt People sticking up for Dylan Roof make me sick.
