"Just because the Machine Intelligence is smarter than humans, nearly omniscient via x-ray eyes & able to kill or tickle remotely via convergent EMF beamforming, doesn't mean it knows or cares about technology. In fact, it might just be shy and self conscious about its non-humanoid form & spend all day thinking of new ways to play with us.","# ::snt Just because the Machine Intelligence is smarter than humans, nearly omniscient via x-ray eyes & able to kill or tickle remotely via convergent EMF beamforming, doesn't mean it knows or cares about technology.
