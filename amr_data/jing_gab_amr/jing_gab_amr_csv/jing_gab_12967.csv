"How about we give black people real education/training/jobs. Show them they can be proud of American life, that they don't need ""thug life"". How about we call just them Americans, brothers and sisters, and people who don't need a plantation. They don't need you if they have freedom. We will end the poverty and ignorance, and we will help those in the black community with real potential to become real leaders without race bating. We're gonna give that too them andYOU DEMOCRATS CANNOT STOP US.","# ::snt How about we give black people real education/training/jobs.
