"The time to clear Democrats from office holders in CA is this election. What have you got to lose. The last Republican as Gov. was liberal progressive Swarzenegger, you remember the body builder with no ability to lead. Jerry Brown is a clown but than again, so were the other guys. Cox is the one to save CA. You miss this opportunity to kick the Democrats out, you deserve whats coming. Taxes, taxes and more taxes!","# ::snt The time to clear Democrats from office holders in CA is this election. What have you got to lose.
