"Yup - totally don't give a shit what a person does in the privacy of their own home. That's their business. But, try to shove your sexuality in my face or go out of your way to fuck w/ bakeries, etc. Then that's a BIG FUCK YOU. That's just wrong no matter religion, politics or sexuality. Live and let live. Love and let love. We CAN all get along.","# ::snt Yup - totally don't give a shit what a person does in the privacy of their own home. That's their business.
