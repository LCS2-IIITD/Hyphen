"If even James Mason is telling his readers to capture control of the GOP, you siege-posters are out of excuses for rewarding anti-white extremists with the objective of subversive acts intended to disenfranchise you. The GOP is the party of white people. None of us can afford to let our enemies just HAVE it without a fight, and we certainly can't afford to let the Democrats hand control of the state over to non-white invaders. You want accelerationism? You get that by winning. Not by pretending that you're doing your folk a favor by losing on purpose","# ::snt If even James Mason is telling his readers to capture control of the GOP, you siege-posters are out of excuses for rewarding anti-white extremists with the objective of subversive acts intended to disenfranchise you.
