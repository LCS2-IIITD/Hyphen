"I feel left out. I want a strait pride parade...or a strait pride day. But then again, none of us strait folk announce where we stick our penis or where we allow a penis to enter our vagina. It just isn't the most important aspect of our lives. We eat, we shit, we pee, we have sex...those are normal functions of every day life. When you exalt any one of those above the rest of your life?
