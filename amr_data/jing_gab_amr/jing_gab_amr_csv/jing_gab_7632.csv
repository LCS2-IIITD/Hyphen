"Trump said he will 'send the military to our border' to 'close the southern border'. I think it is pretty obvious he is not going to issue shoot-to-kill orders on unarmed civilians, which would be refused as illegal orders anyways. Posse comatatus prohibits the military from arresting illegal alien civilians. So how is this supposed to work? I would really like to know the details.","# ::snt Trump said he will 'send the military to our border' to 'close the southern border'.
