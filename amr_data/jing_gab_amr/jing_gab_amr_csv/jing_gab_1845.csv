"Brett Kavanaugh is a judge's judge - he respects judicial opinions more than he respects the words on the page or the intent of the people who ratified the Constitution. He's no Scalia, not even a Gorsuch. He may be a tiny bit better than the guy he's replacing, but not by much. Amy Barrett would have been a better pick. Nobody would ever call her a rapist.","# ::snt Brett Kavanaugh is a judge's judge - he respects judicial opinions more than he respects the words on the page or the intent of the people who ratified the Constitution.
