"Oh yeah. Sounds like what Schrodinger said. He quit the Quantum Theory in disgust, saying he didn't like it and was sorry he had anything to do with it. He focused on a much less disturbing concept, ""What is Life?"" He wrote a book by that name, Watson read it, was inspired, and carried it around with him as he discovered DNA with Crick using Schrodinger's Quantum Theory Wave Equation. Anyway, what was Schrodinger's conclusion in his ""What is Life?"" book? That we aren't confined to the bones of our skull, we are embedded in the Universe. It's all mixed together.","# ::snt Oh yeah. Sounds like what Schrodinger said. He quit the Quantum Theory in disgust, saying he didn't like it and was sorry he had anything to do with it.
