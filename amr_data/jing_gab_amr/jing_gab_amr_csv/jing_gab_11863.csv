"Raise your hands who used Moscow subway lately? Overcrowded and dirty. The pic is clearly taken as a prop, off-hours. The system within the Ring (Koltsevaya, a station on the pic is Kiyevskaya) was built as a show symbolizing the might of communism and kept by both federal and Moscow governments. Yes, the gold tiles use gold leaves. The stations built later, or % of the total now) do not offer the USSR museum style. NYC was built as a commute utility. Dirty and dysfunctional now because the city and the state are run by communists.","# ::snt Raise your hands who used Moscow subway lately? Overcrowded and dirty.
