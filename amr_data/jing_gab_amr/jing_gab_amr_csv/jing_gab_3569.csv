Yet it's not all trolls or bots there are plenty of verified officialson there. And it's not like they are not taking action based on what they say. Most super-rich elites are Jews or have financial ties with jews as to have shared interest. Most people at the top are Jewish. That'snot a mere coincidence that they all happen to push a similar agenda.,"# ::snt Yet it's not all trolls or bots there are plenty of verified officialson there.
