"Donald Trump sent a message to Eric Holder on Thursday, after the former attorney general told supporters to kick Republicans. He better be careful what he is wishing for, that I can tell you, Trump said in an interviewon Fox and Friends, Thats a disgusting statement for him to make, for him to make a statement like that is a very dangerous statement. Holder was captured on videochallenging former First Lady Michelle Obamas statement that when they go low, we go high. No. No, Holder said. When they go low, we kick em. Thats what this new Democratic party is all about, he said. Trump cautioned Democrats to be careful with their rhetoric, noting that his rallies with supporters were calm and well run. We dont have problems with our rallies, he said. Trump reminded the audience that Holder was found in contempt of Congress and that he went after Christians as well as the Tea Party. Holders got some problems, and I dont see him running and if he did run, I think he gets gobbled up before he even gets to the election, I think the primaries would gobble him up, he said.","# ::snt Donald Trump sent a message to Eric Holder on Thursday, after the former attorney general told supporters to kick Republicans.
