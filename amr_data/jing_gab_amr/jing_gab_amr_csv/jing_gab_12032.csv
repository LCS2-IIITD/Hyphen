"Dude, it's the john lennon's ""imagine"" political and spiritual theory of life. It's exactly why our nations are turning into shitholes while they sit around turning everything into an argument about money and rights. Nothing ever about duty, honour or the future - unless they are trying to tell YOU what they think YOUR duty is or what YOU should be doing that's honourable. And the only future they care about is what Dow futures looks like.","# ::snt Dude, it's the john lennon's ""imagine"" political and spiritual theory of life.
