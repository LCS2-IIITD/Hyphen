"Im gonna flush and fill the coolant in the Camry this weekend. Also gonna use a turkey baster to remove as much Power Steering fluid out of the overflow tank and refill with fresh fluid, once a week over the next few weekends. Ordering rotors and pads for the front disc brakes, for next weekend. Just ordered new aftermarket headlight assemblies, as well.","# ::snt Im gonna flush and fill the coolant in the Camry this weekend.
