"Sen. Cory Booker Admits Democrats Don't Care If Kavanaugh is Innocent We all know that the Democrats are all about power. At times, they will run over anyone that gets in their way. This became abundantly clear Tuesday when Sen. Cory Booker opened his mouth and said exactly what we were all thinking. He claims that the Democrats dont care if Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent. He just confirmed what we already know! In a bizarre, very telling statement Tuesday, Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) appeared to state that it didnt really matter to Democrats if Brett Kavanaugh were guilty or innocent. This statement sent shockwaves throughout the political community, as well as social media platforms. If that is the case, then we need to stop the madness and confirm Brett Kavanaugh For Supreme Court Justice immediately. Everytime Booker speaks, it is like a gold mine for us conservatives. He used language that frankly shocked Booker claimed in a statement. Booker went on to say in a statement to the media Tuesday that it didnt matter whether Kavanaugh was guilty or innocent because he has shown himself to not be worthy of the sacred institution of the Supreme Court. So, according to Booker, even if a man is accused of sexual assault, and he is innocent, he shouldnt be upset. Keep in mind that these false allegations have ruined Kavanaughs life, and his families as well. Kavanaugh has spent the last years making a good name for himself. His reputation is impeccable. That was until these false accusations came to the surface. The bullet hit its mark and did what it was intended to doto ruin a good mans name. However, Booker didnt stop there. So my hope that beyond the vicious partisan rancor that is going on, Booker said, beyond the accusations, we dont lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country and ultimately ask ourselves the question is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment. As you may recall, the Senate Judiciary Committee submitted the case to the FBI for further investigation. However, this wasnt good enough for the liberal mob. They continue to move the goal post everytime we meet their demands. Dont expect this to stop. They will continue to move the post until they get what they wantPOWER. As Sen. Lindsey Graham said last week when he was talking to the Democrat Senators, all you want is power, and I pray to God you dont get it! Folks, if these bandits who call themselves Democrats obtain power, that will be the end of our nation. You can bank on that. That is why you need to get out and vote this November. PUT AN END TO THIS MADNESS!!","# ::snt Sen. Cory Booker Admits Democrats Don't Care If Kavanaugh is Innocent We all know that the Democrats are all about power.
