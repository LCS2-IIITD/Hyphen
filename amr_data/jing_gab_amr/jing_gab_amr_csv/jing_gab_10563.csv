"Criminal Feinstein, If you didn't arrange and leak ""Dr."" Ford's letter, why did you have her retain lawyers? When were you planning on releasing her letter? Never? After Kavanaugh was seated on the SC? If Blase Ford wanted this to stay secret and was assured it would be, why would she need representation? No! This was an insurance policy from the get go. This was fabricated from whole cloth. How convenient for you that Ms. Ford lives in a liberal state (your state) and in a liberal district. This is no coincidence. You wanted to be a hero to the warped liberals who support you. You are dirty, Sin. Feinstein. Your plan backfired. Now look at you. I and many, many others have lost what little respect we had for you. I hope you like extremely hot eternity. I curse you for the damage you have done to Judge Kavanaugh, his family and the United States of America. I don't give a rip about Ms. Ford. She was in on this, IMO.","# ::snt Criminal Feinstein, If you didn't arrange and leak ""Dr."" Ford's letter, why did you have her retain lawyers? When were you planning on releasing her letter?
