"This is considered ""garbage"" by the Swedish SJW government now, with its Muzzie cultural minister (or whatever that position is). Sweden is literally throwing away or melting down Viking artifacts these days because Sweden is now no longer Sweden and is whatever invaders from the Middle East and Africa say it is. Girl needs to hold onto this sword or the government will destroy it as part of its drive to destroy/erase the past that clearly showed what Sweden was and SHOULD be.","# ::snt This is considered ""garbage"" by the Swedish SJW government now, with its Muzzie cultural minister (or whatever that position is).
