"If you want to see tons of proof of what the LGBT pedo globalist push is doing to sexualize and gender bend YOUR innocent little kids and grandkids please watch this jaw-dropping -minute documentary and share it everywhere online and email it to friends, family, and co-workers. You won't believe what they show in this video and what is being taught to YOUR kids and grandkids every single day in schools. This is being pushed in public and private schools in all U.S states and in Europe, Australia, Russia, Canada, Iceland, and Latin America. I bet you didn't know (Vader didn't) Planned Parenthood is not just in America it's the number one heavily funded tool used by globalists to keep the worldwide population down or in check, push the toxic feminist ideology (lowers birthrates), and to mass sexualize children under the IPPF (International Planned Parenthood Federation)umbrella who's in over countries. A pamphlet/book called, 'Happy, Healthy, and Hot' pushed and endorsed by the United Nations says you DON'T have to tell potential sexual partners that you have HIV, in 'It's Perfectly Normal', and the ""It's All One Curriculum' that has and is being given out to tens of millions of children is recommended for kids under ten years old. In these three pamphlets it shows graphic images ofkids and adults masturbating, teaching five-year-olds that masturbation is not harmful, gay sex, in the 'It's All One Curriculum' they use the term ""sexual pleasure"" times, the term ""abortion"" is mentioned times and it says ""there is no right age to have sex."" Classes now wherenine-year-oldlittle girls are taught how to put a condom on a plastic penis. Here's the link to the -page 'Health, Happy, Hot' pamphlet: chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/ And if you're asking yourself why would the WHO, UN, EU, and Planned Parenthood push this stuff on our innocent kids? - Money $$$. - Brainwashing and mindcontrol. - Creating the next generation of feminazis. - Population Control. - Make our societies disease and mentally ill riddled and hateful of the opposite sex. Pushing this evil agenda means more STD's, more pregnancies, more depression, anxiety, suicides, and mental health issues, and more abortions which means hundreds of billions of dollars to be reaped by globalist owned Big Pharma, hospitals, and Planned Parenthood to sell off baby parts like an assembly line. % of all AIDS cases in the U.S are with gay men whomake up less than % of the entire U.S population. To save our children and our society we must homeschool our kids/grandkids or at the very least get them into some sort of religious-based school until you can homeschool them. -DevilDog","# ::snt If you want to see tons of proof of what the LGBT pedo globalist push is doing to sexualize and gender bend YOUR innocent little kids and grandkids please watch this jaw-dropping -minute documentary and share it everywhere online and email it to friends, family, and co-workers.
