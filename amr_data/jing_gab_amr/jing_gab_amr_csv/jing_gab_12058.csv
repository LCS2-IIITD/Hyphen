"Happy belated birthday, ! Thanks for sharing 's gifts! Atlas Shrugged is the reason I'm here. In the s I was a Communist, and all things Right were anathema to me, including Republicans. (To this day I still have no loyalty to the Garbage Party.) Back then a conservative tried to sell me on capitalism; his arguments were rational, but I wouldn't listen because of the rest of the right-wing package.Atlassucceeded with me where he hadn't for two reasons. First, it wasn't burdened with conservative baggage. The word 'Republican' is nowhere to be seen in the book. Second, it's a story. Stories hit home harder than dry economic arguments. I devoured this story in about three days. When I closed my library copy three decades ago, I was a changed man. I've continued to change since then. You and others on Gab have changed me. I'm not the guy who first signed up here two years ago. But again, I wouldn't be here if not forAtlas. I confess I don't know anything about Asatru, so all I can say is that the sight of the second book made me realize that Japan is the only major country I can think whose native religion is still going strong. Imagine if the pre-Christian religion of the Germanic nations had the status that Shinto does today. As for 's book, I love it. I read it right afterSomeone Had to Say It.Have you read that already? If not,Civil War is still readable as a standalone book. I was offline when I read both books. That was for the best, not only because that enabled me to concentrate on his words, but also because I would have been tempted to quote too much. Any random passage from either book is thought-provoking. I hope to write more about those books on Gab soon.","# ::snt Happy belated birthday, ! Thanks for sharing 's gifts!

"Despite my strong Nationalist leanings I still love Ayn Rand. Not just her but Leonard Peikoff and especially Nathaniel Branden. Her books are all chicken noodle soup for the souls of the lonely intellectuals who feel totally isolated in a world full of ignorant and incompetent people. As Michael Tsarion said: ""...reading heris medicine."" As much as I think we could benefit from some benign form of collectivism I just don't see it happening on anything other than a local scale. People have become so psychologically broken that there is no hope for a large scale collectivist Right Wing revolution, that ship sailed in . Her work as well as the work of Nathaniel Branden is important because it will show you how to heal yourself, focus on self-improvement, the achievement of your goals and the development of authentic self-esteem. This is what helps to rebuild a man's soul, broken by the toxicity of modernity, into a healthy and intelligent individual capable of taking charge of his destiny and overcoming the odds stacked against him. I don't agree with all of her philosophy, but I think she is a must-read for anyone who feels lost in a world full of zombified masses and who is looking to break free from the insanity of normality. She is one of the few female intellectuals who has completely changed my life forever and I recommend her to everyone who will listen. I wrote an article some time ago explaining my stance on the Individualism vs Collectivism article, you should check it out. It was one of the most difficult, yet rewarding pieces I've ever written because it really made me think about how my philosophy and worldview differs from hers and helped me to gain some intellectual independence from both her, her Objectivist school as well as the more Nationalist and Collectivist thinkers who I also admire. Thanks for your thoughtful post. I always enjoy discussing Rand with those who have read her with intellectual maturity and experienced a profoundity of catharsis and personal growth that Rand so often inspires.","# ::snt Despite my strong Nationalist leanings I still love Ayn Rand.

Weak, docile, passive, dependent, insecure and malleable. There needs to be a healthy balance of Individualism vs Collectivism, or more correctly, Microcosm and Macrocosm. We have a duty to OUR SELVES to ensure we are fulfilled spiritually and psychologically healthy. But we also have a duty to our Volk to ensure we produce a society on a macro level that is a stable foundation for raising the next generation of our blood. It's not a black/White sorta thing.
