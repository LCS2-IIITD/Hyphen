"Except SA Sommers already sent a memo asking a judge to seize and put everyone under a gag order. That was yesterday. It's a national security issue. That means it was done today. If you don't want to go to federal prison I would stay off chan, qmap, et al. The memo specifically cited those sites based on material on his person and what was expedited off electronic devices. They could've walked away from once they learned the truth that and made this thing trend.
