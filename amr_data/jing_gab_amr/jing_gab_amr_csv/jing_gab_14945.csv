"New Zealand Portal: EU Has Become the Dictatorship It Aimed to Defeat The European Unions purposeful bullying of the United Kingdom, and attempt to serve up the independence-seeking nation as an example to other European member states that would consider going it alone, has left it becoming the kind of dictatorship it was created to prevent appearing in Europe, a New Zealand report has claimed. Published toStuff.co.nzNew Zealands largest news portal which serves as the website for a number of the nations best selling newspapers, the article by columnist Karl duFrenseslammed the EU and drew clear allusions to previous attempts to force control on Europe by imperious Grand Viziers.

In a jointly-signedletterpublished Thursday, prominent Brexiteers including Boris Johnson, David Davis, and Jacob Rees-Mogg warned May that the deal she was working to achieve was no Brexit at all, and that if a betterfuture for the nation is thrown away because of EU bullying and the Governments desperation to secure a deal, then the British people will not forgive us.
