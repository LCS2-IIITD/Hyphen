"VIDEO: Pro-Trans Mob Attacks Newspaper Office for Running Ads Against Letting Men Self-identify as Women Transgender activists have picketed and attacked a newspapers offices with smoke bombs after it printed an ad opposed to letting biological men self-identify as women. The activists chanted slogans, unfurled Trans Women are Women! banners, andreportedlythrew smoke bombs into Northcliffe House on Friday afternoon, filling the entrance of the London building with fumes and shutting down the street. The building houses the offices of the right-leaningDaily Mail, which has occasionally questioned transgender ideology, and theMetro, which printed an ad arguing against legal changes which could allow biological men who identify as women into womens changing room and rape crisis centres. The protest is thought to have been aimed at theMetro, but ironically only online staff a completely separate team that had nothing to do with the printed ad were in the building at the time. The ad urged readers to Think about it and in bold letters, arguing againstproposed changesto the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) which would allow biological men to legally declare themselves women or self-identify with no medical checks or treatment. Last year the Conservative Partyreportedlybackedthe plan, before the Government Equalities Office changed tack in June andinsistedthey would not compromise womens rights. Many womens and feminist groups, including Fair Play for Women (FPFW), which was behind the ad, have argued the changes pose a threat to biological women. FPFW was called transphobic for the ads, but insist they support the right of transgender people to live safely and free from discrimination. They add that the right of [biological] women to live safely is also important, however, and must not come at the expense of transgenderism. The Advertising Standards AuthoritytoldPink Newswebsite earlier this month it will investigate whether the FPFW ad violates advertising standards. A spokesman said adverts should not contain anything that is likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Particular care should be taken on the grounds of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age. Ads should also be prepared in a socially responsible way, they said. We have received a small number of complaints about the Fair Play for Women ad which we will assess carefully to establish if there are any grounds for further action. In judging whether those rules have been broken, the ASA takes into account the context and medium in which an ad appears, the audience thats likely to see it and prevailing standards in society. Ads may contain opinions, views or ideologies that may be distasteful to some without necessarily breaking the rules. A government consultation on the changes to the Gender Recognition Act finished thisweek, making the debate in recent weeks more urgent. UKIP London Assembly Member David Kurten criticised the proposals,arguing: Theresa Mays governments proposed reform of the Gender Recognition Act to allow anyone to self-certify as the gender they are not is a preposterous attack on objective scientific truth.","# ::snt VIDEO: Pro-Trans Mob Attacks Newspaper Office for Running Ads Against Letting Men Self-identify as Women Transgender activists have picketed and attacked a newspapers offices with smoke bombs after it printed an ad opposed to letting biological men self-identify as women.
