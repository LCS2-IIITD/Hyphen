Tommy Robinson's team told you to get lost NOT his ex PA - his WHOLE TEAM. You hang on Bluehand's coattails for same reason plus the added bonus you can abuse women...except for this one. Are we a tad limp now? Never mind...go and chat up Sheila I'm sure she'll find you another victim tout suite.,"# ::snt Tommy Robinson's team told you to get lost NOT his ex PA - his WHOLE TEAM.
