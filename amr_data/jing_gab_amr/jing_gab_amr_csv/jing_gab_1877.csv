Same debate has raged for decades. Every election is the most important ever. We had massive heated debates about McCain and Romney. I do think it's important to vote GOP if a Dem is the President for gridlock purposes. I like gridlock in DC. With the GOP it doesn't matter - you get gridlock even if they have majorities except on their neoliberal economic agenda,"# ::snt Same debate has raged for decades.
