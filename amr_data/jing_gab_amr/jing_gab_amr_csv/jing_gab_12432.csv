"More evidence that Trump's Judas goats have totally infiltrated the Democrats. General Michael Hayden is a former CIA and NSA director. He decided to be a smartass and take issue with Trump's factual tweet. And then Hayden was genuinely shocked by the response. This former CIA and NSA director IS UNABLE TO READ THE PUBLIC MOOD. He is so obtuse and oblivious that he could not anticipate the rage that average Americans feel at being screwed by leftists. Someone told Hayden to get in on the act. ""Fight fire with fire! Go on Twitter and be snarky! This is what wins elections!"" Hayden is too STUPID to perceive what was said a long time ago: Trump's supporters take him seriously but not literally, while Trump's opponents take him literally but not seriously. Trump has mastered social media. It's a VERY specialized skill. Hayden HONESTLY thought that he could arrogantly tell Americans to sit down, shut up, and accept open borders and caravans of illegals. He is STUNNED that the American public is no longer enslaved by the elites. This CLOWN is one of the many reasons that the US floundered for so long. He looks to others for advice. The people he looks to for advice are CLANDESTINE TRUMP AGENTS. Trump hires TONS of spooks. Of all the people Michael Flynn put into place, only ONE had been photographed. All those people retained their TS/SCI (Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information) security clearances after Flynn resigned. I call them the Leak Killers. Although their names are open source, I never repeat them. THEY are the reason the Trump administration has not been crippled by intelligence leaks. The recent leaks are penny ante, and my guess is the leakers were set up. George W. Bush and Obama suffered from leaks that blew massive intelligence operations. The leaks severely damaged our ability to fight terrorism. Trump has suffered no such leaks. He and Flynn PLANNED THIS. The Leak Killers were hired, given their TS/SCI security clearances, and then put out of sight in the vast federal bureaucracy. They ruthlessly police the Intelligence Community, making sure that nobody spills the beans about the important stuff. Michael Hayden is a buffoon who has no idea how Americans think and feel. He was therefore easily tricked into shooting himself in both feet. This is happening daily. The Democrats are DOOMED.","# ::snt More evidence that Trump's Judas goats have totally infiltrated the Democrats. General Michael Hayden is a former CIA and NSA director.
