"I got off Facebook because it was a huge waste of money. ""After months of emailing, he finally had a scheduled appointment with a Facebook executive on October , . However, after he raised more than $600,000 in support of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Facebook canceled the meeting and deleted both of his pages. To add insult to injury, Kolfage had over the years dropped more than $300,000 in advertising on his pages."" Facebook lets about percent of your followers see your posts. If you buy ads, that numbers goes up to about percent maximum. The best way to screw Zuckerberg is to ensure a red mega-mega-mega-MAGA-tsunami in November. Big Tech will be blamed, so all these psychos will have their faces rubbed in their own manure. They're going to be hated by everyone. Since Zuckerberg and Dorsey can't bear criticism, they're going to drink until their livers explode. Watch it happen.","# ::snt I got off Facebook because it was a huge waste of money.
