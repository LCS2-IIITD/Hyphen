"Last Evening I watched an old Errol Flynn & Ann Sheridan movie Edge of Darkness about Norway resistance fighting nazi's to protect their homes, it was a very powerful movie with Patriots fighting fascist the same as we are in this country today! They both quoted this one line I think is very apropos today! ""IN THESE TIMES WE MUST BE LIKE STEEL!"" What does that say to you personally?","# ::snt Last Evening I watched an old Errol Flynn & Ann Sheridan movie Edge of Darkness about Norway resistance fighting nazi's to protect their homes, it was a very powerful movie with Patriots fighting fascist the same as we are in this country today!
