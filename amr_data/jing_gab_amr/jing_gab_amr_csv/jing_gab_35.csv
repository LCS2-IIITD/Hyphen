"Well , I finished the k assault course in the top % of runners.. Very proud of our group of alt-right runners, who all gave a great account of themselves and raised over to advocate for the protection of white SA farmers. And now for the bad. I did not see ANY diversity at the run - not one single representative of the rainbow coalition was there for the event. It was boring, everyone looked the same (plain white), no good music, no good restaurants during the run... NOT representative of the diversity which makes our nation so great. Why are leftists so fat?","# ::snt Well , I finished the k assault course in the top % of runners..
