"There are closed door investigations going on on several fronts. Pence is working with top Military officials to address the China and foreign aggressors. Meanwhile Sessions, the NG, and the Q team are addressing the Globalist Coup inside our nation's govt. Sessions has an impeccable reputation for Constitutional Law, he is excellent at it (much like Ted Cruz). Sessions is making sure things are sealed tight when literally thousands of arrests are made. Trump's business skills are proving to be a major strength. He knows who is good at what they do, and what needs to be addressed, and where to assign the right ppl, as he oversees things. He doesn't micro manage, but he knows how to lead and how to hold the leaders he assigns accountable. God has the right man in office. Not sure that many ppl would be able to untangle all the tentacles of the Deep State, but Trump is gifted at it.","# ::snt There are closed door investigations going on on several fronts.
