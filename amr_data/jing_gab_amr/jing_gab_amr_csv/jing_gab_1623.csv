"How many Globies here will prove they are Globe Earth Dummies after reading this meme? Please take your time and do the math with a Earth Curvature Chart, so not to incriminate yourself. I did, and Im no dummy. You might find a difference in a few feet, but not thousands of feet. Please do the math with common sense and don't feel bad; many intellectual people are Globe Earth dummies, too. We all were once brainwashed with this fake crap.","# ::snt How many Globies here will prove they are Globe Earth Dummies after reading this meme?
