From the earliest days of Gab there was a verified user called He would post inane memes with a picture of his goofy face and Bible verses or platitudes and they would trend with + votes.

I called him out.,"# ::snt From the earliest days of Gab there was a verified user called He would post inane memes with a picture of his goofy face and Bible verses or platitudes and they would trend with + votes.
