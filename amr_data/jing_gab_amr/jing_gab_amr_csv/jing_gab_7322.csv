"Many of you guys know I am not lily white...and not even REMOTELY Aryan... yet you have befriended me without hesitation. The left wants to depict us as a festering hive of White Supremacist ""nazis"". Gab is more than ""Hate Speech"". For one thing, there is no such thing as hate speech. It is a figment of emotion-driven leftist intolerance. We are a vast community of free thinkers. We respect the opinions of others, though we may disagree. We know that the First Amendment comes before all others, because tyranny begins the moment they attempt to silence us. Color is inconsequential, but character is everything. Good men and women died for MY right to speak freely, and BY GOD, I will. Especially to fight leftist lies.
