"Right-Wing Anti Mass Migration Party Wins Historic Majority in Quebec, Canada Election The right-wing anti-mass migrationCoalition Avenir Qubec (CAQ) has won a historic majority in Canadas French-speaking province, promising smaller government and improved border controls. The party managed to oust the former ruling Liberal Party on Monday winning a majority of seats in Quebec which has been governed by either the centre-left Liberals or the separatist centre-left Parti Qubcoisfor the last five decades, the CBCreports. The CAQ, led byFranois Legault who was a former member of the Parti Qubcoisand formed the CAQ in , campaigned on a mix of traditional conservative platforms that included promises to reduce the size of the provincial government, as well as more populist policies on the topic of immigration. In May, the party promised a values test for newly arrived immigrants along with athree-year deadlinefor migrants to pass the test and show proficiency in the French language. We do not want to keep too many people who do not accept our language, our values and to participate in the workforce, Legault said. If the person does not want to learn French, they will not have their selection certificate, so they will never be a citizen.Theybecomea person without status and its up to the federal government to decide what to do with that person, he added. The new government has promised to reduce immigration numbers overall by percent but will likely require concessions with Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus federal Liberal government to implement such reforms. The party has also been one of the strongest in Canada in opposition to the full-face Islamic veils known as the burqa and the niqab, with the CAQs spokeswomanNathalie Roywriting: And although we will not ban them, we are not afraid to say it: We remain totally against the niqab, chador and burqa. We must send a clear message we do not like the idea of these symbols of the oppression of women. As part of that policy, the party intends to introduce asecular charterthat would ban the wearing of religious symbols like the niqab or the hijab for school teachers, police officers, and any other profession that employs state authority and power. The election of the CAQ follows that of populist-conservativeDoug Ford in Canadas most populous province of Ontario earlier this year. Ford, who also defeated a provincial Liberal Party in alandslide victory, ran on a Trump-like platform railing against the political elites of the province. The two election results in Canadas largest provinces bode badly for Prime Minister Trudeau who has seen amassive drop in the pollsfollowing a series ofgaffesandscandals including spending billions of taxpayer dollars on theTrans Mountain pipeline expansion project that was eventuallyhalted by a courtin August.","# ::snt Right-Wing Anti Mass Migration Party Wins Historic Majority in Quebec, Canada Election The right-wing anti-mass migrationCoalition Avenir Qubec (CAQ) has won a historic majority in Canadas French-speaking province, promising smaller government and improved border controls.
