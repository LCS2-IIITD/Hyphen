"Here's another reason I'm not interested in going back to Twitter. I used to read everything Max Boot wrote. And then he was bought off or blackmailed or lost his mind or decided to expose himself as a total fraud. We can't even count the videos of Trump supporters being beaten bloody by mobs, but Max Boot ignores them and concentrates on Pelosi being shouted at. Twitter is the domain of the soulless. I feel MUCH BETTER not going there. Sometimes I read Trump's feed, and that leads me to tweets like this one, but for the most part I stay away from Twitter. Most of you had never heard of Max Boot. He was a great intellect. I admired him a lot. But like Jim Treacher, he turned out to be a massively negative mental patient who--like the Democrats--will fight to the death to prevent YOU and ME from having better lives. These people are well paid regardless of who is in power. Therefore we must conclude that they're all like George Soros and take pleasure in ruining the lives of millions. When I was a child, my biggest fear was that all adults were crazy and dangerous. Although I'm not AFRAID of people like Max Boot, I DO hate them, because I know from personal experience that they will never stop. We have to do things THEIR way, or they will work tirelessly to destroy us. This is a generic mindset that was created by horrendous childhood abuse--but that doesn't matter. Hitler, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein were all abused. Bashar al-Assad was abused. Jack the Ripper was abused. It doesn't matter WHY these people won't stop. All that matters is the fact that they won't stop. Luckily Trump feels the way I do. When people make their beds, they get to sleep in them. Certain words and actions allow you to write off people. You no longer have to worry about their welfare. If Max Boot called me and said, ""I'm on fire! Bring a bucket of water!"" I'd hang up the phone. Because if I put out the fire, he'd resume trying to destroy me after he recovered. And he'd say, ""So what? You were stupid enough to save me. Blame yourself."" See, I've had all of this happen to me. I know what I'm talking about. But everything will change after the midterms. Just watch,","# ::snt Here's another reason I'm not interested in going back to Twitter. I used to read everything Max Boot wrote.
