"A bit of revisionist history from Travis LeBlanc. What anyone on the TRS forums knows is that it was open season in Richard Spencer there. And it was most certainly encouraged by the owners of TRS. If you criticized an owner of TRS, (((Weev))), Andrew Anglin, or Ricky Vaughn, you got banned. If you criticized a number of movement people that were on the 'purge list' like Richard Spencer, no problem whatsoever. The only thing that interrupted this process was Paul Nehlen's doxing of Ricky Vaughn. As for the Daily Stormer ""pushing out toxic elements from the movement"", there is no more toxic element in the movement than (((Weev))). Greg Johnson says he agrees with LeBlanc on this, which is an outrage.","# ::snt A bit of revisionist history from Travis LeBlanc.
