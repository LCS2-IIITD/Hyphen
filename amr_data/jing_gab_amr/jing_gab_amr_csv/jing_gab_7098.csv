"Remember WHERE DID HATRED FOR THE FLAG START? U.S. Code, Title , Chapter , Sec. ... During rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present (except those in uniform) are expected to stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. Or, at the very least, ""Stand and Face It"". Senator Obama replied : ""As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived as taking sides"" ""There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression.."" ""The anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all that sort of thing."" Obama continued: ""The National Anthem should be 'swapped' for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song 'I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing'. If that were our anthem, then, I might salute it. In my opinion, we should consider reinventing our National Anthem as well as 'redesign' our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and love.Its my intention, if elected, to disarm Americato the level of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren. If we, as a Nation of warring people, conduct ourselves like the nations of Islam, where peace prevails, perhaps a state or period of mutual accord could exist between our governments"". When I Become President, I will seek a pact of agreement to end hostilities between those who have been at war or in a state of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive thoughts. We as a Nation, have placed upon the nations of Islam, an unfair injusticewhich is WHY my wife disrespects the Flag and she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past"". ""Of course now, I have found myself about to become The President of the United States and I have put my hatred aside.I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation, and offer the people a new path.My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country's First black Family. Indeed,CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of America."" Yes, you read it right.","# ::snt Remember WHERE DID HATRED FOR THE FLAG START? U.S. Code, Title , Chapter , Sec. ...
