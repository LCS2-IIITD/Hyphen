"The Democrats have either won every special election (so far), or severely cut Trump's margin of victory in '16. This doesn't bode well for the midterms. Imagine the Republicans defied all odds and won a super-majority in both chambers of Congress. What would change for us? Virtually nothing. They'll privatize social security and send our troops to Iran.","# ::snt The Democrats have either won every special election (so far), or severely cut Trump's margin of victory in '16.
