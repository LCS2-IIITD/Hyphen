"Over the weekend while I was away attending a funeral, my sweet baby cat Nera died...she was the best cat I've ever owned, and was truly unique. It breaks my heart I wasn't home when she passed...I hope you'll indulge me posting a photo and a painting of her. The painting was done by Candace Wagner last year. Please give your pet a hug or pat before you leave the house, each and every time.","# ::snt Over the weekend while I was away attending a funeral, my sweet baby cat Nera died...she was the best cat I've ever owned, and was truly unique.
