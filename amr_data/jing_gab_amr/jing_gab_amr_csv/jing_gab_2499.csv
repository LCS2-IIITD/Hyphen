"The Democrats have either won every special election (so far), or severely cut Trump's margin of victory in '16. This doesn't bode well for the midterms.

They'll privatize social security and send our troops to Iran.","# ::snt The Democrats have either won every special election (so far), or severely cut Trump's margin of victory in '16.
