"Before we go ahead and canonize Brett Kavanaugh, it would be well to understand that the man is a judge. He has probably caused the ruination of the lives of many people, including some who did not deserve that. What do judges do? Almost all of them will not allow constitutional arguments in their courtrooms. Almost all of them reject jury nullification of bad laws. Almost all of them send people into cages for violating (usually unconstitutional) ""mala prohibita"" such as drug laws and gun laws. I'm not sad Kavanaugh was confirmed, as it's always fun to bloody the nose of the leftists. But the Supreme Court is a fixture of the Deep State. It is not a friendly institution.","# ::snt Before we go ahead and canonize Brett Kavanaugh, it would be well to understand that the man is a judge.
