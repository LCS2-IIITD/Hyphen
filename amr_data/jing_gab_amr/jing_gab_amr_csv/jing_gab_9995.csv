"But why? This is a bet you should win with % certainty. After all, you claim to be Q. If that were true, you know you'd be right, and have no problem agreeing to this, because there would be no possible way you could lose. Amazing how you won't put your money where your mouth is. Despite months of bombast, when it comes down to it, you chicken out. And don't worry, Microchip, traitorous subversives will get rounded up, too. You working with embedded Mossad agents certainly qualifies. Do you think they'll go light on your sentencing, though, considering your mental handicaps?","# ::snt But why?
