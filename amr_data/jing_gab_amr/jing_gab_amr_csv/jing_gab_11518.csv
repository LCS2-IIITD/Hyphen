"Do you get it now, white girls? You're not allowed to think for yourself. You are required by coercive measures to think and act as you are told. Otherwise, you are bad. But guess what?

You better wake the fuck up.","# ::snt Do you get it now, white girls? You're not allowed to think for yourself. You are required by coercive measures to think and act as you are told.
