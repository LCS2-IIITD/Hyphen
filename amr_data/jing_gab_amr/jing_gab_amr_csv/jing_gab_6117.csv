I am a nuisance to Torba because I am pissing and shitting all over his right wing BBQ cookout. But it is ultimately his tweets that made this entire thing worse for him.

At least when he finally bans me(which will support my claims even more).,"# ::snt I am a nuisance to Torba because I am pissing and shitting all over his right wing BBQ cookout.
