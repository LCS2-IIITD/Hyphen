"Folks, PLEASE, get your e-mails in to POTUS, let your followers know what's going on. Gab is acting really whacky this a.m., taking forever to load notifications which do not load. Quoting from an earlier post below: Attention all Gabbers: From Andrew: ""Breaking: , Gabs new hosting provider, has just pulled our hosting service. They have given us until am on Monday to find a solution. Gab will likely be down for weeks because of this. Working on solutions. We will never give up on defending free speech for all people."" From me: PLEASE e-mail POTUS Trump - this is election tampering in my opinion. Gab is one of the last bastions where conservatives can speak without censorship, and we need to protect our rights. Why aren't Twitter and/or Facebook being sanctioned? For the very same post Gab is? PayPal denies Gab service, where does it end? Will banks be closing our accounts and denying us service because we are conservatives? And this morning on Fox, more headline news involving Gab","# ::snt Folks, PLEASE, get your e-mails in to POTUS, let your followers know what's going on.
