"Funny how people can think this way without a shred of physical evidence, a plaintiff who can't remember anything about the day in question, multiple witnesses who clearly state she is lying, a defendant who actually has evidence to show he wasn't there, and dozens of letters vouching for the defendant's character. Like I always say, Social Justice is just a politically correct term for Mob Justice.","# ::snt Funny how people can think this way without a shred of physical evidence, a plaintiff who can't remember anything about the day in question, multiple witnesses who clearly state she is lying, a defendant who actually has evidence to show he wasn't there, and dozens of letters vouching for the defendant's character.
