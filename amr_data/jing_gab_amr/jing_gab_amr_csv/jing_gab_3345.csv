"A Black school teacher, Shonterikka Williams, was fried after she told her Asian student to be less chinky & stop doing oriental things.

These are the people teaching your kids.","# ::snt A Black school teacher, Shonterikka Williams, was fried after she told her Asian student to be less chinky & stop doing oriental things.
