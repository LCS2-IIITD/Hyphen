"I guess you live in a would where you control everything and everyone does exactly what you say. But that isn't realistic. I've dealt with a similar situation that our president is in, leading an organization which includes people who undermine the leadership. It's not easy, and in fact it sucks. And the Presidency is not a goddamn Dictatorship. So cut the guy some slack because he's done a hell of a lot in the last two years against a fuck-ton of opposition.","# ::snt I guess you live in a would where you control everything and everyone does exactly what you say.
