One of my friends is gay. He's not outwardly gay. He's just a person. God made many different types of people and creatures. They are all God's people and creatures. Yet some people want to exploit this for their own craziness...Some people get lost because they have been abused...was that the plan? Was the plan to strategically abuse people to mess with them?,"# ::snt One of my friends is gay. He's not outwardly gay. He's just a person. God made many different types of people and creatures.

"Yup - totally don't give a shit what a person does in the privacy of their own home. That's their business.
