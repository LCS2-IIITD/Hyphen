Here's the truth! Homosexuality is the result of the soul being reincarnated into the same gender too much! There is a balance to everything!

Love and Light!,"# ::snt Here's the truth! Homosexuality is the result of the soul being reincarnated into the same gender too much! There is a balance to everything!
