"Boomers were not old enough to vote for the '65 immigration act, desegregation, or anything else. In California, at least, they turned out to vote for Prop . The problem is as soon as they came of age, they did nothing to correct the mistakes of their elders and even made things worse. I can't think of a single boomer politician who isn't a sack of shit.","# ::snt Boomers were not old enough to vote for the '65 immigration act, desegregation, or anything else.
