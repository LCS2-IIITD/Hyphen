rumoureval_0,"Debunk This: ""throughout human history, while % of women have reproduced, only % of men have""","I can't even find the source of the claim.It implies that the source is this linked scientific paper: the information doesn't appear to be in there either.It's certainly an interesting claim. Not sure if I want to see it debunked or bunked.::so it's actually worse than that if you look into the full story.::That :1 ratio is a big anomaly though. That's what makes it worthy of a whole article. It says:&gt; In more recent history, as a global average, about four or five women reproduced for every one man.Which is closer to the :40 claim but way higher.::It's certainly not true today. Census numbers show that the number of women who have given birth is in the -60% range and the number of men who have fathered a child in the -50% range.Historically, however, there was a lot of pressure and expectation on women to conceive. In many cultures it was considered their only purpose and value. Whereas there has always been a place for the celibate man, I wouldn't be totally shocked if those numbers weren't way off counting all of human history.",real

rumoureval_30,Debunk this: The '97% consensus' of scientists on climate change is complete bunk... fraudulent statistic repeated everywhere is based on blatant scientific FRAUD,"Lol natural news.On a serious note, even if the % consensus is ""bunk"" the science is not.Edit: I'm going to expand on this a little more and explain why the science is not bunk:Firstly, we know that CO2 traps heat, it is a greenhouse gas just like methane and water vapour. The way these molecules trap heat is easy: they absorb the radiation, keep it then radiate it out in all directions. Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues.The way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback, which is a way of saying ""something causes itself"". Heating the atmosphere has another effect, heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG, yeah you're seeing where this is going. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more GHG's it can absorb and so on.Now where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2. Yes plants and trees absorb CO2, the issue is that this cycle (aptly named the Carbon Cycle) was in equalibium, the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving. Now it is not equal, the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase.I hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand.(I'm a student in my rd year of environmental science with year being mostly CC so AMA I guess?)::Oh oh, Skeptoid did an episode about this recently! Another important thing to note is that we can tell the difference between carbon sources based on the amount of C14 isotopes they have. Since C14 is made in the atmosphere and likes to decay, things that are alive have proportions of C14 to C12 in line with the atmosphere, with some notable exceptions. Things that are dead lose their C14 as it decays to the more stable C12. Since the stuff we're concerned about is ""fossil fuel"", fuel derived from the remains of long-dead life forms, it has no remaining C14. We can check the proportion of our atmosphere composed of C14 to C12 and tell that the vast majority of added carbon in the CO2 is C12. The only other real source of massive amounts of C12 being pumped into the atmosphere is volcanoes, and we know how much CO2 they're pumping out. It's much less than the increase of CO2 we're experiencing, doesn't explain the increase.::I know the consensus is real, but I would like to specifically debunk the info in this particular article. I see that the quotes in the article are taken from a book about climate denial. Here are some links I usually use to support the consensus:::This is the entire problem with using bandwagon fallacies as an argument for something. You end up arguing things that really shouldn't matter - it doesn't matter whether , or % of scientists ""endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming"" - and arguing the percentage is a waste of time. If they want to argue against man made climate change they need to provide evidence that the climate isn't changing due to man's actions.Still - here we are.First thing I noticed was that it talks about one survey, when multiple have been conducted showing similar percentages, the wikipedia article you linked talks about Harris Interactive's survey of randomly selected scientists, the paper in Environmental Research Letters that looked at abstracts - I believe there have been others. The site seems to ignore these.The other things that jump out at me are.&gt; the researchers then selected of their sample and declared them experts.""Well no the researchers did not do that, those surveyed did - by publishing papers on climate change - it shouldn't be a surprise that out of scientists only of them were climate scientists... It's a poor way to decide if man made climate change is correct or not - but I don't think the poll claims that it is.&gt; So if I send out an email survey to people, and then I hand-pick the responses I like the best, then can I proclaim those results to be ""settled science"" too? Will Al Gore champion my cause and demand billions in reparations from first world nations on my behalf?No because it doesn't prove anything, nor is that an accurate description of what happened, nor should this (sadly it is) used to describe how correct anthropomorphic climate change is.So sure, if we ignore all other surveys that confirm the statistic - then this alone as a support for anthropomorphic climate change is weak, usefully there are other things supporting man made climate change other than one email poll.::[deleted]::Ew::you would think this guy would know bunk when he sees it. look at all the bunk for sale on that page alone::The linked article does have an element of truth in it, in that the statistic is often stated incorrectly. The [Doran (2009) study]() found that % of those respondents with the greatest level of expertise in climate science agreed that ""human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures."" The NaturalNews article seems to suggest that these respondents were cherry-picked to produce the desired result, but they represented those ""who listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than % of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change."" This is naturally going to be a much smaller subset of scientists, but it includes those whose knowledge and expertise is arguably most relevant.This result is often shorthanded in public discourse to ""97% of scientists agree,"" but that's not an issue of scientific fraud. The scientists explained it fully in their publication.It's also relevant (but not addressed in the NaturalNews article) that several independent studies have been done using different methods, and reached very similar conclusions.

rumoureval_72,Would Labour win if young people voted?,"Interesting that Green support doesn't trail off as you move up in the age groups. UKIP peaks at the same age Tories do, Lib Dems peak in the s-40s.::Greens have a long base in the anti war movement and environmental politics (shockingly). Those people arent going to turn tory as they get old or are at least very unlikely to. The lib dems/non-corbyn labour/conservatives/ ukip all over lap in some areas (whether they like it or not). And this is where people often move parties.::To be fair, the greens didn't have much to trail off from.::There is also the obvious point that if young people did vote the Tories would make a greater effort to try to appeal to them, so the numbers should not be taken as constant.If I've learned anything from the NUS, its that it is really easy to get students to get on your team if you do something simple that appeals to them.::Jesus, legalise weed and make it mandatory every pub must have a pound pint Thursday and you'd have the NUS sucking you off::I'm and I'd vote for that.::Second year student here, can confirm.::You can look at the BES2015 which gives this data as well, which had far more accurate sampling methods. I'll drag out the table when I open up my computer, but one of the questions was ""which party do you usually associate with"" and it had Labour marginally ahead (you'd also need to look at Scotland of course).::As far as I can see BES only make their data available in SPSS and Stata formats, which while I have access to at work is a bit more than I want to deal with on a hungover Sunday morning.::Yeah they do. I put it into PSPP and then copied and pasted it into excel. It's big though because they ask odd questions to k people. I'd share, but the answers are often coded, so don't make sense (eg who did you vote for has answers of , , , etc which relate to parties).::I think it would be this chart I would need, but it doesn't copy nicely into excel., I dont quite understand why when its meant to be actual vote it shows under s.However just eye balling that I dont think it would change the answer, since it shows Tory's with about the same support at the lower age groups but Labour with lower. % at the lowest age group in BES vs. % in the data I used.::Sorry - I didn't explain myself well. You are extrapolating the existing voters into the non-voters and assumed they'd vote in the same way. The BES asked even the non-voters which party they supported, so we can see how many said they supported Labour and the Conservatives, but didn't vote.::Ahh ok, however the complication is the BES includes a ""I wouldn't vote"" category, and I'm not sure how you would deal with them in the alternate scenarios.. Probably you would have to say that even in the % voting case that they still wouldn't or would spoil their ballot because they don't support any party.I might have a play with incorporating that later, right now I should probably do the work that this procrastination was designed to avoid while still feeling like I was being productive.::The real question is; would young people be as shafted as they are now, if their turnout was as big as the older generations?::Considering that all things being equal young people *become* older people, no.::Just compare what has/is happening to the policies that effect young people - university tuition fees, [cuts to spending affects them most](), unable to own a house, junior doctors' contracts etc., and what old people are getting... triple-lock pensions, a (overvalued) house (/mortgage repayments - not controlled by the government etc.The benefits the elderly have to do will not be reaped by the old people of tomorrow.::&gt; The benefits the elderly have to do will not be reaped by the old people of tomorrow. Except that people vote more as they age, which means that new policies that benefit them will be needed if parties are to get these ever ageing people to vote for them. So whilst they might not have identical policies benefiting them, they will have other policies benefiting them.I'm annoyed that I've been downvoted for this as it isn't a difficult point to understand and it is objectively and necessarily correct. Young people, en masse, get older.::Bu they'll still be worse off because of today's policy changes. Also, how sustainable due you think the policies the elderly receive are? As you said they won't have today's policies, but similar if not greatly different, policies - which will not be as good as today's. Furthermore, it's dependent on that they'll vote more as they get older, they still might be politically apathetic. If it helps, I haven't downvoted you...::&gt; Bu they'll still be worse off because of today's policy changes.Yes, for a time, until they become part of a voting block that votes in greater numbers in which case their needs will be better served.&gt; how sustainable due you think the policies the elderly receive are?As sustainable as any Ponzi scheme.&gt; As you said they won't have today's policies, but similar if not greatly different, policies - which will not be as good as today's.So they won't do as well, they'll just do well.&gt; Furthermore, it's dependent on that they'll vote more as they get older, they still might be politically apathetic. There is no reason to believe that just because previous generations have done so that future ones will also, but it is a reasonable supposition.&gt; If it helps, I haven't downvoted you...Thanks, I wish more people were like you.::Since when did Greens get %?::EU Elections::This is just a consequence of demographics, the younger age groups are really small compared to the older ones [as you can see here.]() -44-year-olds are % of the electorate, Labour need to win with the older demographics if they are to win the election, simply doing well with -34-year-olds, which are only % of the electorate isn't enough.::So Labour lose in every single scenario?Good. (Also, thanks for putting the time and effort into this, it's interesting.)::It's unsurprising. Ed Miliband had all the charisma of a damp sock and spent all of his time agreeing with Cameron and co.Still, good work on crunching the numbers OP.It was like watching this:::No is the short answer. You are assuming that each generation is of equal size. But the + group has five times the number of people of the -24 group. So even if turnout was the same for both groups the + group would outvote the -24 group by sheer force of numbers.::No I'm not? I use population demographics from Wiki, thats stated in the text and shown very clearly in the calculations.::I do wonder why none of the polls show any change in older voting for Labour since Corbyn was elected.Maybe its patronizing but... surely having an older bloke as leader would get older voters voting Labour?Maybe its the policies he needs to enact? What sort of policies to old people like?::&gt; What sort of policies to old people like?Not those which Corbyn like, except for things like nationalisation on the railways. There are not fans of immigration and multiculturalism, unlike Corbyn.::It's not really about image, more about ideology.Old people have assets that they want to hold on to; voting Conservative will allow them to do that better than Labour. Also things that Labour consider important to their ideology such as workers' rights, education and housing, don't apply so much to old people.::&gt; What sort of policies to old people liketaking away peoples benefits, restricting the internet, banning pornography, etc.::[deleted]::Labour were in power for a long time and never did it, even though it probably would have benefited them. There are lots of legitimate reasons for being against it beside self interest.::[deleted]::The Representation of the People Act - it reduced the voting age from to .::feels like a more suitable age sometimes::I think (as a hard right winger) that if we're going to make year olds fight and die for their country, then we *must* give them the vote.::&gt;that if we're going to make year oldsWe don't ""make"" year olds do that. Or do we still have conscription that hasn't stopped from WW2 yet? Maybe I am behind the times on this policy, enlighten me.::Right now we don't ""make"" year olds fight, but we have done and probably will do.::[deleted]::&gt;16 year olds can join the armed forces, should we allow them to vote?16 year olds can't be deployed in a warzone, so no.::&gt; I'd say the majority of year olds have no idea about politics and how it affects them.At what age do does this stop?::I have to say, whilst I admire the effort this is basically worthless because it only corrects for differential turnout between different age groups and not for differential turnout within them. Whilst the conclusion might be correct (I've no idea) the model sadly isn't.::Thats what ""simple and rough"" means. I would expect turnout within age groups to be a second order effect of a magnitude less than that between groups. I am not aware of any evidence which shows that young tories are more or less likely to vote than young labour supports.::Well, perhaps, but it could equally well be described as 'simplistic and inaccurate'.Turnout varies enormously by social grade, with % turnout from those in grade AB and % turnout from those in DE. AB voters lean Conservative (45% Con, % Lab) and DE voters lean Labour (27% Con, % Lab). Both groups account for roughly % of the population.So it's entirely possible that if you accounted for differential turnout according to both age and social class, you'd get a different result, and find that uniform turnout would have changed the results (ie voters represented a skewed sample of the electorate). To do that meaningfully you'd need (good) polling data dividing the population up by both criteria, though, and I'm not sure such data exists.::I'm not sure I agree, the party support percentages were based on polling, which presumably included non voters, so the case where everyone votes should not suffer from this issue.::Sorry, which party support percentages?::The figures in the nd table.::That doesn't include non-voters. It is a description of 'how Britain voted', after all.",unverified

rumoureval_122,"How much truth is there in the statement that ""Only %-20% of actually soldiers fired their weapons in WW2?""","That claim is based on the books ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society"", by David Grossman; and ""Men against Fire"", by SLA Marshall.I'll get my bias out here - I think this idea is crap, and the basic reason is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and there is no evidence to support that claim.Marshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that % of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists.In fact, the only record of his interviews at all (besides his books), makes mention of soldiers firing weapons, but nothing whatsoever that could support a hard number of how many men fired or did not fire.There is no evidence of statistical analysis based on his interviews, no records of questions about whether soldiers fired or not, no questions about ammunition consumption. There is no evidence from quartermasters about ammunition consumption, barrel wear, or any other secondary evidence.So this number is one that Marshall may have arrived at honestly, but there is simply no evidence to support it.If you're interested, Robert Engen wrote a very incisive article on the subject in the Canadian Military Journal, and wrote his Masters thesis on the subject.Engen found (and has the evidence to prove) that - for Canadians, at the very least - did not have this problem. Based on primary sources (written post-combat interviews with Canadian officers), he found *exactly the opposite* of what Marshall and Grossman claim.Canadian officers found that their forces fire was very effective, and, if anything, their men fired *too much*!So - there's no evidence to support this claim, and there is primary source evidence that it is BS.If you'd like to read Engen's article in the CMJ or his thesis, here they are: the interest of (a little) balance, Grossman makes a (in my opinion very feeble) defense of his work and Marshall's in the CMJ as well:::*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman. I think Holmes presents a far more rounded view of the infantry soldier's experience and does a much better job of analysing why soldiers fight (or not) and the effect that it has on them. It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true. Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?The major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and, in common with the majority of social research, it is impossible to control for the relevant variables:&gt; ""Everyone stop! OK, now I want Smoggins to stand up and lets see if Gruber over there fires at him.""Almost everything in this area is laced with bias. Soldiers don't want to be seen as cowards, commanders want to believe their men are good fighters, very few people understand what battle is actually like, very few psychologists are soldiers, very few soldiers are psychologists and it is very rare to find scholars with relevant military experience who can combine academic rigour in both history and psychology. *On the Psychology of Military Incompetence* by Norman Dixon is a good example: Dixon was a Major in the Royal Engineers and an esteemed psychologist, but the historical section of his book is extremely suspect - especially his treatment of World War One.Against this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research. What is not in any doubt is that western militaries have gone to great lengths since the end of World War Two to develop sophisticated, realistic training environments to prepare soldiers for battle and develop instinctive responses to stimuli: in effect to stop the soldier from thinking.::&gt; Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?What on earth?::Sleeping bags are comforting, and a bombardment can be *really* scary. Also, there were accusations of incredible negligent and shoddy leadership on the Argentinian side (there were trials regarding to extremely poor treatment of the conscripts fairly recently), which would explain very poor reactions to incoming fire. [Der Speigel article on the accusations]()In general, people do not act rationally when put under sudden and extreme stress, especially if there isn't any stable presence to guide their reactions. If your commander is telling you to get to bunkers, directing you to positions, and acting like he's still in control of the situation, you're going to have a much better chance of reacting well. Absent or poor leadership? You're now scared, and have no idea what to do in this new, scary situation.::[deleted]::As far as I know that term usually applies to the lack of knowledge of enemy unit positions rather than battlefield confusion.::I'll have to hunt out the exact passage if you want more gen, but despite having better places to take cover they resorted to using sleeping bags. Remember that these were poorly trained conscripts. not professional soldiers.::Also, Grossman cherry picks his battles. He commonly claims that artillery and other crew served weapons do the majority of killing even in a direct action, yet one can with very little trouble find several battles where one or both sides had little trouble inflicting terrific casualties on the other using accurate and deliberate fire, without artillery being involved. The Battle of Inkerman would be my favourite example.::In other words, all those bullets went somewhere?::Above all, the Allied infantry was more than willing to lay fire at their oncoming Russian counterparts with devastating accuracy, which runs counter to Grossman's entire thesis.::This is a great answer. I have read all books you mention, discussed it with professors and veterans. Many people agree that his number is either fabricated or based off a ""gut feeling."" What is important about Marshal's work is that it brings to light much more than just the firing rate. There are whole sections on command and training that have been accepted and incorporated into modern training. For Grossman, I feel like his point was a bit weak. Basing your work on already shaky research makes it hard to come to a clear and concise point. Linking violent video games to aggressive behaviour is popular and sells copies, but that might just be my biased interpretation of things. Like /u/kombatminipig said, he is very selective in his evidence.Finally Engen. All I can say is that he is a top notch academic, and *Canadians Against Fire* is a solid piece of work.::Could someone track down the records of ammunition given to each soldier before and after each battle and from there find out how many soldiers fired their weapons? Or do those records not exist?::If the records did exist, they wouldn't prove that the soldiers fired their weapons at the enemy, just that they were fired at all.::I feel like Grossman would argue that the ammo was discarded, or given to the few that were firing, and that everyone then lied about where it went. Because camaraderie.::You could also check the guns to determine if they'd been fired. Soldiers trading weapons to hide the fact that some aren't doing their jobs seems unreasonably complicated.::Well, we can't check the guns of WWII soldiers now, and I would be surprised to find a primary source on that suitable for statistical analysis.Ammo consumption would be possible to find sources on, I'm just not sure how fine grained it would be. Probably down to battalion level at least, maybe company, probably not platoon.::[removed]::&gt; Marshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that % of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists.Tough to extrapolate onto the soldiers KIA who would likely have had a far higher ratio.::An interesting thing to consider.::This claim comes from 'Man Against Fire' by S.L.A. Marshall, who was a US Army historian for WW2. He's fairly controversial, as is the book, and the %-20% figure comes from his book, although it's misquoted.For one, he's basing it off interviews he did, which isn't exactly a good piece of evidence. Also, it's more specific then is stated. Only -20% of *American riflemen* fired their *personal* weapons *at an exposed enemy soldier*. This makes the statistic a lot more understandable, because it excludes crew-served weapons (machine guns), and key weapons (flamethrowers).While his numbers were initially accepted and frequently quoted, they've been called into question several times. One of the larger things I've seen pointed out in rebuttals of his statistics is that it fails to distinguish between soldiers who *can* fire, and shoulders who *should* fire. A medic has a sidearm. Should he be firing at an exposed soldier, or should he be doing his normal duties? What about squad leaders, more focused on directing the battle then taking shots themselves?[This]() is an excellent breakdown of why his methods were called into question, and includes an interview by the man who accompanied him through his interviews in the Korean war (which came up with a % fire rate). Some sample issues with his work include that he didn't interview casualties, only unharmed men who were still ready for action, that he didn't take into account things like weapons jamming, and that his numbers were based more on guesses then anything else. It wasn't a proper survey even, but instead a group discussion he'd pull information out of.Simply put... it's just not very good history. It's hard to get a proper number for how many soldiers fired their guns, but the -20% is more or less impossible to back up, and completely ignores several significant factors.::It's also talking about ""at an exposed enemy soldier"". Meaning that pointing in the general direction of the enemy doesn't count. But, per an earlier comment, the soldier can still be firing their weapon and therefore using up ammunition and causing wear on their gun barrel.::Isn't the term American riflemen referring to Marines, making those arguments about their duties etc null?::The term ""riflemen"" can be applied to everyone with a rifle. I believe you are thinking of the phrase ""Every marine is a rifleman"". While that is true, the reverse is not (Not every rifleman is a marine).::Firstly, no, ""riflemen"" is not specific to the Marines.Secondly, I suspect you're referring to ""every Marine is a rifleman first."" This does not mean that the Marines consist of no role but infantry riflemen, but only that Marines of all roles are expected to be competent to effectively engage in combat with a rifle. The Marines still have people performing all the different duties that any other branch does.::Probably referring to S. L. A. Marshall's findings, reported in Men Against Fire and other places:&gt;The thing is simply this, that out of an average men along the line of fire during the period of an encounter, only men on average would take any part with the weapons. This was true whether the action was spread over a day, or two days or three...In the most aggressive infantry companies, under the most intense local pressure, the figure rarely rose above % of total strength from the opening to the close of an action.And&gt;It is therefore reasonable to believe that the average and healthy individual--the man who can endure the mental and physical stresses of combat--still has such an inner and usually unrealized resistance towards killing a fellow man that he will not of his own volition take life if it is possible to turn away from that responsibility...At the vital point he becomes a conscientious objector...Marshall's conclusions have not gone unchallenged, and are still discussed today. [Apparently his methods were not very rigorous or scientific](), and there's lots of reasons for a soldier to not fire his weapon, even in a close engagement with the enemy. (Do keep in mind that the weapons of the time were powerful enough to make even a fleeting and momentary glimpse of the enemy a good opportunity for a kill. These weren't firing lines yards apart. Even an earnest killer might not have abundant opportunities of actually shooting someone.)Still, after WWII they led to innovations in training to increase rate of fire.::Ah yes, Marshall's study on combat fire ratios. The answer is: no one knows. There's a lot of explosions and confusions during war, keep in mind % of all casualties in WWII was from friendly fire ^ (over the years this decreased as our forces became more organized or alternatively the enemies after WWII we fought were less and less organized then the Axis). Many people have cried bullshit at his studies, his studies were poorly documented, were based on after action interviews, and said things like ""Brennans account also reinforces the contention of critics of Marshalls use of statistics, who conclude that Marshall was unscientific in his methodology and that his figures about the percentage of troops firing their weapons were either sloppy, fabricated, or simply guesswork. ... Nevertheless, unlike the recollection of the Armycaptain who accompanied Marshall in Europe in World War II that he could notrecall Marshall ever asking who had fired his weapon, Brennan does recall thejournalist occasionally asking that question directly in his interviews in Korea."" ^1I would like to mention a scene in Maus, the comic book / biography in which the author's father is ordered to fire his weapon, so he blindly fires it, partly because he's unwilling to take another life (although later he does kill a German soldier). ^3 In a google search I just made, somewhere between to rounds were expended per kill in Vietnam. That is because of suppressive fire. But I must say that it's hard to figure out the motivations for suppressive fire, it could be caused by combat stress or opposing enemy suppressive fire causing soldiers to , or it could be a result of a psychological factor that results in people to avoid aiming directly at an enemy (few people want to kill another person).I also would like to say it's pretty unlikely for soldiers to admit in front of their comrades that they didn't even attempt to kill an enemy. Unfortunately nothing is certain in war, maybe when we attach cameras to the guns of soldiers we could get a better glimpse, but even then... nothing is certain.I apologize that this post falls a little short of the standards of this subreddit, but this question is probably better asked in r/military/ or r/asksocialscience/ .On a final note, Marshall's statistics was part of the reason for the adoption of the M16, it was felt that automatic weapons would allow soldiers who typically don't fire their weapons to blind fire their weapons through suppressive fire.

One group of soldiers, firing from cover, works to get as much lead flying in the general direction of the opposition in an attempt to hinder their ability to fire on another group of their comrades that are relocating elsewhere. It's basically meant to be psychological, discouraging the enemy from doing anything more active than taking cover.::The rounds fired statistic isn't necessarily worthwhile to backup your claim here. You have to understand that seing a target at engagement ranges (100m to m) is actually quite hard, especially in a conflict like Vietnam with all the vegetation. You are trained to overwhelm the enemy with fire support (which leads to suppression) and you don't always aim at a target accurately, more just at muzzle flashes or dust being kicked up etc. Basically where you think the target is you shoot.::I hate to comment on your lengthy, well thought out post with such a short reply but it is all I can muster in my exhaustion. While most ORDINARY men do not want to kill, you will be hard pressed to find a soldier who wouldn't kill to save his life or the people around him. My life or the guy who is shooting at me? I'm pulling the trigger /10.::[removed]::Don't be ashamed, it's a reasonable point I have overlooked.Typical modern battles are kinetic, soldiers rarely fight at bayonet distance, they often fight at (50 to meters away)[] (even in a stress free environment like a shooting range, it's a bit difficult firing at a target that far away). So even if you're pulling the trigger, it's hard to aim, subconsciously you don't want to kill, so when you fire, you might purposefully... miss slightly.That was my point. I'm just saying it's probably a bit more likely that it isn't that people don't shoot, but that people do shoot but don't aim.::&gt;That was my point. I'm just saying it's probably a bit more likely that it isn't that people don't shoot, but that people do shoot but don't aim.Well, that's Grossman's point, too, but neither of you have any evidence to back it up, AFAIK.::[removed]::[removed]",unverified

The Rule of Law matters most. It was created to restrain The Crown, and still does. A pity that it doesn't restrain Parliament. Canada and America have legislatures constrained by written, codified constitutions with human rights codes, and supreme courts with the power to review legislation and strike it down.In the UK, The Crown is the only real constraint on parliamentary tyranny and on tyranny of the majority. The Crown prevents a prime minister from declaring themselves Fuhrer after purging another party.Of course democracy matters, but constitutionalism, rule of law, civil liberties, and a system of checks and balances matter more. If the armed forces sided against The Crown, they would be guilty of perjury. Republicans in Parliament are already guilty of perjury. And even if The Crown exercised real power now, Parliament would still be stronger. Hanoverian Kings exercised deal power daily but were weaker than Parliament. Executive Constitutional Monarchy is as viable and stable as Ceremonial Constitutional Monarchy.::[As of at least bills had been subject to royal approval, including the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill and the Civil Partnership Act.]()::The Queen has the same role as a president in a parliamentary system, to ensure laws are constitutional. If a bill is clearly illegal, she is the last line of defence but she can't just refuse to sign a bill because she doesn't approve of it or doesn't like the direction the government is going.::Prince Charles seems not to realise this.::Corbyn wins again.::You mean King Charles of course.::A tree will bend before it breaks.

Beyond that and Britain will become a Republic again.::I don't think he's smart enough to realise that. We'll probably see the Republic during his reign.::Just don't give another Cromwell the helm. He wasn't so nice to us over here in Ireland.::Its a shame that the people concerned about this were silent when the previous referndum proved that it was perfectly easy to politicise of the civil service, the Bank of England, private businesses depending on government contracts and , yes, the Queen.Indeed many of the same voices seemed to support such action and defend it.It will get dirtier and sneaker if the polls come close.Remember Cameron 'inviting' business leaders to Downing Street, who then went back to their company and wrote to all employees in Scotland::&gt; who then went back to their company and wrote to all employees in ScotlandIn fairness I wish this was the way all corporate lobbying operated.Petition your employees who then petition government and vote in their own interests (while taking on board the company's views).---Corporate political donations could work in a similar way. The amount of money a company was planning on donating gets divided up and each employee gets a 'campaign voucher' that they are free to give to any political party of their choosing. The company then petitions their employees on who they'd prefer the donations go to, why that party is better for the company and its employees, etc. And how the policies of that party will enable the company to grow, wages to rise, etc.Ultimately though the donations would be made anonymously by employees entirely at their own discretion after weighing their employer's arguments against their own views....Union donations would work in the exact same way.::Yep.

Reading between the lines I imagine a conversation did happen at some lunch where she said something negative about the EU to Nick Clegg.After the lunch someone else at the table (possibly a senior Conservative figure?) probably told the story on to one of their colleagues, perhaps over-dramatising it a bit, as a little jab at Clegg (along the lines of ""the Queen had a rant at him over the EU, it was a bit surprising"").That person (if I had to guess, probably someone close to Boris Johnson, if not him) is now supporting ""Leave"" and has therefore leaked what they remembered of it to someone at The Sun (directly or indirectly), who in turn have put their own spin on things.So Clegg probably can't deny it completely as the conversation may have happened - but the Sun's spin (that she supports Brexit and that she 'let rip' at him and so on) may be ""nonsense"" and didn't happen.But that's all speculation...::[**\_clegg**]()&gt; [2016-03-08 :49 UTC]()&gt; Re Sun story.

Seems to me like it's just a case of the Sun trying to goad some sort of response out of Buckingham Palace that they can call a statement of support for one side or the other. Looking through that article for the origin of the headline, we have this:&gt; The account of the bombshell lunch during the last government - which a handful of other government ministers also attended - has been relayed to The Sun by a highly reliable source. It all rather depends on how much we trust the Sun to be telling the truth about its ""highly reliable source"". It's not exactly convincing, quite frankly. Before I'm prepared to ascribe a political position to such a famously political neutral figure, I'm going to need a lot more than a source without a name that comes with The Sun's word I can trust what I'm seeing.&gt; A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: The Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for years. We would never comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims.""Seems entirely reasonable.The Sun are just trying to play the ludicrous justification that because Her Majesty made a very neutral statement in the run up to the Scottish referendum to the effect that voters should ""think very carefully"", that means that &gt;It is now beyond doubt that she made a very careful intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to back a vote for the union. and that therefore&gt;If she has a view on something as big as Brexit, dont voters have a right to know what it is?Pretty unimpressive from The Sun.::Why do you think the Sun printed it? They know shes not going to deny it even if she wanted to. She takes being non-political very seriously.::Denying backing brexit doesn't mean she's pro EU. She won't say anything except there may be some snarky releases from her staff about this front page but nothing substansive. Not being involved is her shtick and she will try not to sway opinion as best she can.::I think even if thise were true (and I am highly doubtful it is) then it's not exactly a revelation. I think pretty much everyone thinks the EU is heading in the wrong direction. The question is what do we do about it. The remain group want to stay and reform it, using the influence of being in the group to make changes. The leave group believe it is beyond reform and never will be what we want.Also denying backing Brexit does not mean that she supports staying, that's a fallacy.::Some people actually like the direction the EU is going in. Also 'reform' can mean a lot. The more Eurosceptic remain supporters want to see a weaker more diluted EU while the more ardent supporters want to see a stronger EU. I personally would support an even more unified Europe but I'm also a filthy pseudo-foreigner (Irish).::So I understand the appeal of a unified europe, even to the extent of a federal entity with current nations as states. But what do you feel about the direction that this is going with regard to things like the lack of accountability in elections?For example the US are having a big debate at the moment to decide their new leader. There are a ton of smaller state elections to work out the party nominees and then there will be a national election to work out who the new president is. But in the EU we don't have that. We're just told Junker is the president as voted for by the leaders of each nation. why should I trust Cameron to pick the right person? Also why do leaders of nations with a population of a few million get the same say as leaders of nations with a population of over million?Surely something as important as who our president is should be something that the entirety of the EU population should get a say in? And this is something that should have bene built in right at the start, not something that we are aspirationally moving towards.What are your thoughts on this?::Did you vote for Cameron to become Prime Minister? No, you voted for an MP and he was selected by MPs.This is how the appointment of the EU president is supposed to work too. It should be someone appointed by and who commands a majority of the EU parliament, this is how many countries select their leader and I have no problem with that. Junker is the first time those requirements were enforced. Cameron trying to block Junker was actually an attempt to deny the people of Europe a say in who was president.Also don't forget, everything the EU tries to pass MUST be approved by EU parliament which has proportional representation and Britain due to its population has a gigantic number of MEPs representing it.::And that would be fine if Junker were the leader of the largest party of MEPs and campaigned as their leader during the election. That would be transparency.Cameron trying to stop it is as much of a problem as any of the other leaders trying to support it. The point is that these decisions are taken far away from the electorate with zero accountability. I doubt the US population would be happy with their president being selected by all the state governors under the argument that any law has to be passed by the House anyway.This is not even close to democratic. FPTP for all its flaws at least is an election. Why are you supporting a system that diminishes the power of voters?::Well the US president is selected by the electoral college who do have the power to ignore the popular vote but obviously that is not really relevant.The EU is trying to make the election of the president more transparent. Bizarrely, it's the people who argue that the EU needs reform such as Cameron who oppose such changes. Also I support the EU because as an Irish citizen, I have seen directly the good it has done for my country. I also see real attempts to make the system fairer and more democratic through documents like the Lisbon treaty.::&gt; I personally would support an even more unified Europe but I'm also a filthy pseudo-foreigner (Irish).That's great. You'll probably get your wish sooner rather than later if we leave.::Well, she can say that her comments to Mr. Clegg were not endorsement of a Leave vote. And hopefully maintain her impartiality::Clegg was an MEP, his group in the EP is led by Guy Verhofstadt who said the EU constitutional treaty was a ""capstone of a United States of Europe"". The Lisbon treaty (an undemocratic re-write of the constitution that the Queen was apparently concerned about as well) passed the same powers to the EU, and gave it a foreign minister, which puts it heavily on a path to acquire an army to back up its foreign policy. There are loads of federalists in Brussels calling for an EU army anyway, and Clegg's party group mates are among them. Yet Clegg to a UK audience says Farage is a barking mad conspiracy theorist for bringing up an EU army. Dishonest in the extreme. Both here and in the other place lib dems are massively overrepresented compared to the population so criticising Clegg always gets downvotes but I simply don't care, he's one of the most dishonest politicians in modern politics. I am sick of the federal question being avoided by these people. No other trade group has a foreign minister and serious proposals for an army, it's a farce to see people pretend this is all about trade, it's a federation.::I won't dispute that Guy wants greater integration, but its disingenuous two mention that without pointing out that he is calling for a ""two speed Europe""; i.e. the eurozone nations would pull together in order for the single currency to be effective as possible, whereas counties which want to stay out of the euro like the UK, Sweden and Poland would be ""associate members"" under his ideas, with an opt out of further integration, but full access to the single market. Which if you ask me sounds like the best way forwards for europe.::I am not so sure we can take anything that's said by these people on face value anymore. Two speeds maybe, but there's only one destination. Look at the bullying of Switzerland at the moment now they have it encircled. That's what would happen to an ""associate member"" sooner or later. I can't believe that's being done partially in my name. It's a disgrace. These people have not stopped when the people have clearly told them to stop by shooting down treaties, I don't think we can consider them to be playing an honest democratic game at this point.::&gt; Clegg was an MEP, his group in the EP is led by Guy Verhofstadt who said the EU constitutional treaty was a ""capstone of a United States of Europe""...There are many things to criticise Clegg for but attacking him because someone who wasn't even an MEP until (Clegg stood down as an MEP in ), who now leads the political group that didn't exist until after Clegg left the European Parliament (and which formed out of a merger of the group Clegg was part of and another group), is an EU Federalist, is a bit of a stretch.::It's funny how the leave supporters on here seem to be delighted when their elected government is possibly undermined by a decidedly undemocratic institution. The irony.::This implies she's actively trying to interfere, which she isnt.Personally i'm glad the Queen of England considers herself British rather than 'European'::A minor point but there hasn't been a Queen of England for + years. England stopped being a kingdom in the s - also kind of in the s when it absorbed Wales, but it kept the name that time.::True, I don't think she is trying to interfere but some people in this thread do and yet support it.::Urm, not really mate.::I too have heard from anonymous sources that overheard Prince William, our future monarch and the most popular royal, was unabashedly pro-European and hoped the time would come with it would become a federal entity but with a constitutional monarchy that would switch households every decade with his European counterparts. Completely anonymous but totally trusted sources.::That could be kind of cool. Take turns on the imperial throne.::Yeah, but she doesn't does she? Or should I say; if she does, we wouldn't hear about it.::Well, the two people in the conversation were apparently the Queen and Nick Clegg. They both deny it. The other party in this claim is The Sun. The Sun. Which of course we can trust because it's not like they're heavily biased to campaign for an exit because they have a tyrannical media puppet master owner who wants out nor have they ever printed blatant lies to sell newspapers and further their agenda. /s::We know the Queen wants Scotland to stay in the UK, therefore she will be firmly in the remain camp.::The Queen backing anything as big as this is absolutely undemocratic. I don't believe for a moment she is so stupid.::From what I gather, she made the comment at a private dinner, that's not an attack on democracy ffs::The queen who has given more than anyone for this country, who lived through the nd World War, who has seen us through many conflicts, and the great depression. I'm sure a little kid on the internet calling her stupid really cuts deep.She is entitled to have an opinion of her own, whether you like it or not. Now before you explode with phony outrage, answer me this. Why is the queen stating her opinion on the matter provided sh has little power 'undemocratic'? She isn't enforcing anything on to us by stating what she thinks.::&gt; who has given more than anyone for this countryIn what way?::Some people see feasts and banqueting as hard work worth a salary of millions.::It's undemocratic because she has far more power than my grandma or any other citizen eligible to vote. Because she has the ability to speak to the Prime Minister directly despite having no explicit approval from the 'demos' I think voicing her opinions in this way is wrong. Why are you attacking me as a 'little kid on the internet'? Please attack my opinions...I actually have a lot of respect for The Queen, when I said I didn't believe her to be this stupid I meant it. My belief is that The Sun is misrepresenting or misinterpreting her words. I hope you don't see this as a personal attack on her, when I really didn't mean it maliciously.This is sort of unrelated but something you bought up: Do you extend the honour of 'seeing us through the great depression' to anyone who was alive during the time, I certainly don't see how our current Queen had any influence on it. Being as she was, roughly years old when it started.::Even as the year old Princess Elizabeth, she was *very* careful not to express her opinion publicly as to whether or not the gold standard should be abandoned. Fact.::she did like doing nazi salutes though::Although she is a symbol of Britain the issue arises from how the British system of government is set up. The British system entirely relies on convention which is what stops the queen from exercising her power to stop legislation passed in parliament and the Lords from blocking money bills. However, these conventions are also not able to stand in a court or enforceable in anyway essentially acting as agreements. This means that the monarch backing a political narrative is an issue because it goes against the convention that the monarchy stays out of politics and strides close to the queen actually influencing legislation which can't happen in a democracy.::This is hilarious::I could have sworn they attacked Prince William about a month ago for being seen to be getting involved in the debate?::Well, it is the most important meal of the day. She didn't get to that age by skipping it, y'know. The whole story sounds like a poor attempt to galvanize people, and sounds pretty fictional to me. Sure is nice that we have press in this country that is allowed to print outright lies on the front cover of their newspapers in the name of a political agenda. Such a great way to run a society.::Makes sense the sun would run with this, after murdochs statement that a UK out of Europe would be easier to control there is reason for him to spread his poison swill.::The Queen is famous about keeping quiet about her political views. Unfortunately, this was likely going to happen at some point because she made a rare point of telling people she wished Scotland would stay in the Union. Given the intelligence she shows in her speeches, somehow I doubt she'd be privy to hypocrisy the likes of which the Sun is accusing her of, but then again the Sun is a Murdoch machine and I wouldn't be surprised if they claimed that Jesus and Winston Churchill were Brexiters as well.::&gt;The reason we all sing God Save The Queen so heartily is because we always believe she is there to protect us from European encroachment.Someone needs to tell JRM our queen is German. Bit late to be worrying about foreign infiltration...Either way i can imagine the butthurt if the article was ""random person claims queen supports EU as brexit is a load of chancers""::How is the Queen German? Because she has German ancestors?By that definition almost everybody in the UK is therefore German or French.::I'm a Dane, here to conquer yer bloody country you anglo-saxon poofs! arrrrggg.::Interesting factoid ""Ta'"" in the north is related to the Danish word (Tak). A lot of northern Lingo is scandic in Origin due to their heavier influence on that area. Possibly pretty obvious but I was mind blown as never really thought about it before I was told it. I was so used to just laughing at Scottish people whenever they claim they're Scandinavian that I never thought of the origins of it.::Wow, that is fascinating! I hope you never mock our proud Scandi heritage again.::Oh I accept the heritage. But I just find this thing of ""oh we're closer to scandinavians than the English"" on the same level of delusion as American Irish people.::Spurious Scandis, if you will.::Sham Swedes?::Well the name was changed from Saxeburg Gthe in to because everyone hated the germans at that point so a bit more recent and a bit more relevant. The main point I make is it's a bit silly claiming the queen is some symbol of British purity or whatever when she and the whole of the royal family almost a perfect example of the opposite. Special note aside for the usual Moggy cringiness of ""Why we all heartily sing God Save the Queen"". Huge fan of the guy on most stuff. but honestly If I didn't know who the guy was I would have thought he was American with how he seems to live in some twee alternative reality of the UK where we all skip around in bowler hats and toast the queen while Jerusalem plays in the background.::Being against the EU is nothing to do with 'British purity'. You've invented that idea to justify the silly quip that the Queen is German because some of her ancestors are German, knowing full well that it's no less racist than saying a black person can't be British because their ancestors are African.::I'm allowed to quip all I want when we're coming out with complete bollocks about the Queen protecting us from ""european enroachment"". Especially coming from a man who seems to be living in a foreigners sketch of British stereotypes. It's a complete nonsense statement in the first place. I thought the unbe-leavers were meant to be the humorless ones?::It is, and so is calling the Queen German.::Holy crap the butthurt I've unleashed from a quip. Sory for daring to make jokes about a stupid statement. I shall stay in silence for fear of triggering anyone.::I doubt the remain camp would take it well if I said staying in the EU was about race-mixing, which is the converse claim to the one you made about British purity.::What the hell are you talking about? It's a joke about a dumb statement. I wouldn't even care if the queen was a full on WW1 German stereotype spiked helmet and everything anyway. Making a joke at someones ignorance of how intertwined european royal families are and have always been is not quite the same as discussing racial purity theories is probably why people wouldn't react the same way.::Nobody cares what The Sun says.::They have quite a large readership and political influence ('it was the Sun wot won it').::People are tweeting at sky as if they wrote the headline... Apparently people don't know how the news works.::When there is no source, and the intent is merely to spread gossip and rumour, they might as well have. Plus Sky, The Sun: there's a pretty enormous connection, you know!::Even though Buckingham palace denied it and the only source is from ""unknown source"" of a witness who apparently saw her say it in . You've got to be a moron to buy the Sun.::Funny, because she was saying [practically everything she possibly could](), in the strongest terms allowed, in favour of remaining in June last year. I'm a republican but have personal respect for the Queen. Her opinion, whether pro (which I think she is) or anti, is completely irrelevant.::It seems you're deliberately conflating Europe and European Union there. You don't have to be pro-division to be anti-political union. I'd even go as far to say that in the sake of European unity a resetting of the EU would be desirable, and that the EU is now actively creating more division by pressing for too much, too far, and too fast. That we're actively seeing the European project create more issues.It's not even an argument against a single market.Margaret Thatcher herself was pro-single market and went to lengths to spell out what it should be and what it should mean in her Bruges Speech. What we also now know is that she was against what this particular single market would become as it's precisely what she warned against; corporatism and central European government replacing traditional roles of national governments.::GOD SAVE THE QUEEN::More crap from Murdoch's 'The Scum' !::Splendid.::We are amused.::[deleted]::We have the ghost of Tony Benn.::George Galloway, Lord Owen (part of the gang of four), Frank Field, John Mills. The SWP is pro leaving, they're still a thing.. Granted, not many. edit: Giles Fraser is alright.::&gt; What would be brilliant is if we had some influential leftists back the Brexit.We ain't that dumb. You have your slap fight and leave us out of it.You can have Kate hoey. In fact, take her as far away as possible.::Good news everyone, we can cancel the pesky referendum thing, our divinely ordained monarch has chosen a side. Now, all in the remain camp must pledge their loyalty and apologise for their treason; any who refuse should be taken to the tower for execution.God I love having a monarchy...(Also posted on r/uk, but they are humourless arseholes less likely to appreciate it, so thought I might as well shoot two birds with one comment)::You might like /r/britishrepublicans(Although, no common stance on the EU ref there)::[****]():&gt;[2016-03-08 :35:33 UTC]()&gt;THE SUN FRONT PAGE: 'Queen backs Brexit' []() [*pic.twitter.com*]()----[^[Mistake?]](/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&ampubject=Error%20Report&amp;message=/49l01s%0A%0APlease leave above link unaltered.)[^[Suggestion]](/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&ampubjectuggestion)[^[FAQ]](/r/TweetPoster/comments/13relk/)[^[Code]]()[^[Issues]]()::Mad speculation already: ""well of course the Brexiters are all royalists so it doesn't matter"" i'm fucking not!::Well if one will read such a vile excuse for a newspaper...::Looks like The Sun may support leave.

Project Fear not going to plan.::&gtroject Fear not going to plan.Yes, it seems to have been struck a blow by Project Lies..?::I'm still baffled by the ""you're just scaremongering"" response to concerns about the ramifications of leaving the EU. It's a bad idea that will have many serious negative consequences, of course the Yes campaign will bring them up.It's like announcing your intention to cycle the wrong way down a motorway, and then protesting that instead of warning you of the dangers people should convince you of the benefits of riding elsewhere instead.::You don't know that there will negative consequences, the ramifications are unknown. I personally believe that there will some pain but that leaving will be worth it eventually. Any comment on what the result of leaving will be is just speculation, the in campaign doesn't make this clear enough.::Funnily enough, I'm writing about consequences that are certainties at the moment. While I believe there will be numerous near-certainties and likely occurrences, these are purely things that will happen. Copying and pasting ruins the formatting, so here's a short sample:- The UK will leave all EU treaties after years from a No vote unless. For this period the UK will be subject to all the laws, but have no vote on them. This will be avoided if:- A qualified majority of remaining member states and a majority of the European Parliament agree and ratify on a settlement.- All remaining member states agree and ratify an extension of this.- Trade deals alone take -10 years or more. Negotiating anything beyond this (such as EEA membership or similar) would take a similar amount of time. More complex deals would logically take longer.- While these timescales cannot be known, a faster negotiation would be record-breaking. - Britain hasnt negotiated a trade deal for years. We would need time to build up the resources and expertise for negotiation and dealing with trade defence cases.- A shorter example is that of the EEA; it took from to - % of UK GDP is linked to exports to the EU, while only % of other EU member states GDP is linked to exports to the UK. Any proposition that that they need us more than we need them and as such the EU will be desperate to give the UK a special deal in rapid time for economic reasons doesnt hold up.- The simplest free trade deal would be EEA membership. This entails:- Large membership fees- Freedom of movement- Following a vast majority of the laws- All three of these are cited by anti-EU people as reasons to leave in the first place, so I personally doubt this would be seen as a better situation.EDIT: I hate formatting.::Doesn't being part of the EEA also give us no say in the law-making process as well?::There is *some* say. The EU does consult the EEA states when drafting legislation, but they don't actually get a vote on it since they don't have any MEPs::Ah, cheers for the clarification!I was worried I was confusing it with the ECC::There are very clear known negatives. The UK will be unable to conclude any trade deals for years which will guarantee a prolonged period of economic uncertainty. This will cause a recession.::dae le project fear??The Queen should be very careful about not turning her position into a political one, if you ask me.::The gloves already seem to be off, it's going to be very dirty campaign. The Queen hasn't actually said anything about her position, maybe that conversation never even happened.::Yes, she should. But that's not what she's doing here.::Fairly pessimistic about this to be honest. I can't see the Monarchy declaring a political view on the EU for either Remain or Leave...Though if this does indeed come out as true. Well that certainly is going to be interesting.::Even unfounded rumours will be a boost to leave, I am glad that leave have taken the initiative.::Cheeky how conversations get out. Looking forward to the story however.::As if this conversation ever actually happened...::It sure did with little Cleggy's denial.::If the Queen really cared she would just use her veto::No way.

rumoureval_147,Debunk This: Microwaves are bad because microwaved water kills plants,"[This has been debunked by Snopes]()According to them, though the ""news article"" that was submitted is from , the first instance of this goes back to . The Misinformation Superhighway just keeps on growing I suppose!::&gt;It has been known for some years that the problem with microwaved anything is not the radiation people used to worry about, its how it corrupts the DNA in the food so the body can not recognize it.Junk science alert! The body doesn't give a tinkers cuss about the DNA of food you ingest, it cares about things like proteins, which are a product of DNA. Oh, and water doesn't have DNA. Or proteins, for that matter.&gt;What about the nurse in Canada that warmed up blood for a transfusion patient and accidentally killed him when the blood went in deadIf that actually happened, that is the stupidest nurse ever to pass the exams. Yes, microwaving blood will damage or destroy the blood cells. But there is a world of difference between eating something and injecting it directly into your veins.::&gt;The body doesn't give a tinkers cuss about the DNA of food you ingest, it cares about things like proteins, which are a product of DNA.If it did, then fellatio-givers would have another thing to worry about.::Also different antigens in blood become more or less active at different temperature.::Mythbusters tackled the plant thing and found it to be busted. If anything, their microwaved water plants were healthier than any of the others they tested. Of course, that isn't to say microwaving water is better for plants, rather, that it has no negative effect.::Where was her control ?, why did she prune newly growing plants ? etc.. Sure it got the results she wanted. But her procedures were horrible. (Edit: Spelling)::Apparently her control was another plant which she watered using water boiled on a conventional stove. Still, a sample size of only plant per group, and no blinding, means that her results cannot be statistically significant.::. Microwaved water is just normal water, but hotter. The microwave radiation does not persist on objects, they are even lower energy than visible light, and just a little higher than radio waves. Radiation itself can not persist on objects for long periods of time, only radio emitters such as uranium, which can give a steady stream of radiation pose any risk whatsoever (rest assured your microwave does not contain uranium)2. Most microwaves no not use water resonance to heat, but instead use dielectric heating (is is more efficient), which uses a rapidly changing electric field to spin polar molecules, causing heating in most materials equally. It functions a little like an induction cooktop",fake

It is a leftover survival instinct.::Just curious here, why would sleeping with our heads *away* from the door be a survival instinct?::Yeah, I sleep with my head toward the door. Does... that mean I'm not long for this world??::You've already signed your death warrant by sleeping that way.::'Cuz when an intruder comes into the bedroom, your feet wake up first, then your head. This extra time ensures you're better rested to fight him off. (apologies to Pippi Longstocking...)::Is that a real quote?::Something like that... Pippi would sleep with her feet on the pillow, so they would wake up first and she could sleep longer!::Oh damn I remember that scene!::So you always have a view of your door in case someone walks in that you need to fight off. Someone or something....::Okay, so why would you face AWAY from it if you want a view of the door?!?!::So we can pop our heads up, look over our feet at the door in case somebody walks in. If we sleep with their head pointing towards the door, we would have to flip around to see the person and they would have their hands around our neck a lot more quickly. So basically we instinctively point our feet towards the door. I believe that's what the guy is saying and I have read that somewhere.::Damn, I'm an idiot sometimes. I was picturing someone laying parralel to the door, with either the front of their body facing the door, or the back of their body facing the door.::Oh, I can see why you thought that. Maybe that is when the guy was saying, that's just not what I read about sleeping patterns.::You can see threats coming more easily and it's easier to defend yourself with legs and arms since they are between you and the threat already.::The WHO says the evidence for the magnetic field of the Earth's effect on human health is weak to non-existent. Moveover, the effects would be due to electro-magnetic radiation, if anything, rather than something simple like ""magnetics pull the metals in your body one way."" That would be easily observable and uncontroversial if that were possible, which it evidently is not.Plus, Indians do a lot of weird stuff, as anyone around the world does. Most folk science is more folk than science.::&gt;most folk science is more folk than scienceholy shit, reading that i just realized that ""folklore"" is composed by the english words ""folk"" and ""lore"", like lore of the folks. i never noticed that. (I'm not native english speaker btw)::Yep! Etymology can be pretty fun. What is your first language?::portuguese. in portuguese, the word ""folklore"" translates to ""folClore"". ""folc"" and ""lore"" doesn't mean anything in portuguese, so i guess we got the word from english::Ohh, interesting! It's always a fun surprise when words cross languages. Russian borrows a lot from English, and English borrows a lot from German. And that's ignoring the German and French origins of a lot of English words, which most people aren't even aware of. Linguistics!::&gt;English borrows a lot from German. but then &gt;...that's ignoring the German... origins of a lot of English words... Wait... what? Also, English words are mostly of Latin origin. French and German origins are slightly less common.::Oh, I forgot to mention that while Latin does heavily influence English, a great deal of that came from French (Norman) influence. English is a strange mixture of Latin roots, and prior to that, a variety of Germanic roots. That's all on top of the original British roots. You might like English to a whirlpool of European languages focused atop England.::The difference I was explaining was words borrowed vs. words etymologically derived. For example, *wanderlust* and *delicatessan* we straight up borrow from German, and an ESL speaker whose native language isn't German wouldn't know that. *Answer*, however, is not a borrowed word, but an English word which was introduced to the English lexicon from the Proto-Germanic language. This is because English developed with influence from the Germanic people coming to England hundreds of years ago, notably the Frisians, Saxons, and Danes. When they went to England, whether trading or settling, the English language evolved to accommodate. So now you see what I mean? There is German influence from pre-Old English that have Germanic origins from hundreds of years ago, and there are German words that English borrowed very recently without changing or integrating the word.To a non-English and non-German speaker, this might be interesting.::Oh yeah! I get what youre saying now. Yes, English borrows from French and German very frequently!! Disregard my other comment.::No biggie! It's confusing wording if the difference I was talking about is not immediately apparent.::Because of the variability of the Earth's magnetic field at the poles, the Inuits have learned to sleep while standing. True story.::You're a really good bullshitter. I nearly believed that::It's the 'true story'.Gets'm every time.::What the hell is this::It is a very common belief in India. Even highly educated people fall for it as such pseudoscience is often peddled by religious people(just search Sadhguru if you want).::There's no difference in the magnetic field on the north and south hemisphere, like there is with the coriolis effect, so the idea invalidates itself.::Smart!::I read a folklore (northern hemisphere) where you were supposed to point your bed North, so it's contradictory.::The earth's magnetic field ranges in strength from to about microteslas (T). If you have ever had a MRI you have been subjected to a magnetic field of about T - around times stronger than the earth's magnetic field at the Poles. And yet it probably had no noticeable effect on you. The earth's weak magnetic field will most likely be drowned out by other sources of EM radiation right in your room - your cell phone, laptop, AC/DC converters etc. We have been using devices that emit EM radiation for quite a long time now - and have yet to see any negative effects.::This is silly, but I'd like to know why some Asian religious traditions have taught people to sleep on *their* left side (the left side of their body.)::I remember reading that it's because if you are attacked while you sleep your heart is better protected...I also remember reading that this was some sort of Ninja and/or Samurai practice. I'm sure I read this on the internet somewhere, so I have no Idea how true it is. Also there's the fact that the heart is mainly central in the chest, with only a slight left tilt so I'm not sure how effective this would be anyway.::If we are going to build from the initial though of self defence then one might consider it would be better to have greater mobility of your right hand (most people being right handed) also reduces the odds that if you are attacked in your sleep then your right hand is less likely to have fallen asleep.Pretty sure it's all just silly folklore though.::I guess when the poles shift some people are going to have a really bad nights sleep... and others a really epic one... until we wake up in the morning and some stuff don't work no more.::I live in the southern hemisphere and if I point my bed in any direction it just snaps straight back to North or South.::The fact that the rules here are totally arbitrary is a clue.

rumoureval_181,Jon Sopel: Bizarre. says he came to Turnberry the day before Brexit and he told everyone that he thought Brexit would happen. And that he predicted correctly what would happen the next day. Umm. Not true. He came the day after Brexit. I was there. June,"[Actual quote from President Trump]():&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.President Trump [left for the UK on Friday th June]() (UK time), arrived in Scotland [some time later on Friday th June]() - around am - and was [getting ready to open Turnberry]() around am.No matter how you spin it he didn't open Turnberry the day before Brexit.The guy couldn't remember basic facts.-------Other gems from the press conference. The whole ""fake news"" for reporting what he said thing, saying ""We left [the Nato] meeting more unified and wealthier as a group than ever before"" - interesting use of ""wealthy"" there.On meeting with President Putin:&gt; We will talk about a number of things: Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, nuclear proliferation. We are massively modernizing and fixing and buying and its just a devastating technology. It is a very bad policy. We have no choice. We are massively big and they are very big and Ill be talking about nuclear proliferation.On Nato spending:&gt; I say we pay percent of the cost of NATO, which is really there for Europe much more than for us.He can say that, but it isn't true. Based on [a couple]() of [sources]() the US contributes % of Nato's common fund, and about % of Nato military spending.On immigration, after some classic dog-whistle racism:&gt; Its not good for Europe and its not good for our country. We have very bad immigration laws. Were doing incredibly well considering we virtually dont have immigration laws I dont even call them laws, you just walk across the border and then youre tied in a lawsuit for five years.On the UK-US special relationship:&gt; I would give our relationship with the U.K. the highest level of special. Am I allowed to go higher than that? They are very special people, its a very special country and my mother was born in Scotland. As far as advice goes, I gave her a suggestion and I think maybe she found it too brutal. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I can fully understand why she thought it might be tough if they dont get the right deal, she may choose to do what I suggested. Its a disgrace how the EU has taken advantage of the U.S.On Russia invading Ukraine:&gt; President Obama failed very badly with Crimea I wouldnt have done that. He took it over during the Obama administration. Well have to see what happens ... Im not bad at doing things. Lets see what happens. This was an Obama disaster. If I were president, he would not have taken over.On Theresa May:&gt; She will do very well. She is a tough negotiator and a very smart and determined people.On the Russia meeting:&gt; Proliferation, to me, is the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. I used to talk nuclear with my uncle. It is the biggest problem the world has, so if we can do something to reduce them, maybe its a dream, but its a subject I will bring up with him. I was telling the PM that Im not going in with high expectations. We have stupidity going on in the U.S. that makes it hard to do something with Russia. People say he loves Russia - I love the U.S. I love China and I love other countries.::He went on about how great he did with North Korea at that presser too.Though: [Congress Moves to Force Trump to Come Clean on North Korea Talks]()::[deleted]::&gt;Trump arrived in Scotland on /6/16::[This is the better tweet](): he left the US on Thursday rd... but by then it was already Friday in the UK.::Yeah seems like he is either blatantly lying or can't remember, which is worse?::[deleted]::&gt;I produce a reputable source (Newsweek) stating that he arrived in Scotland on rd JuneAre you also saying Trump is a liar?::[deleted]::In this case skewing overwhelmingly towards lie::[deleted]::Lol it doesn't though::[deleted]::Soooooo.... he says ""just about to leave to go to Scotland"" in the early hours of the th.. What do you think that means?::""Well if you remember I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit""From the press conference earlier todayI mean that is a blatant lie::You seem confused, so here's also the Telegraph confirming rd: he will open a golf resort. Flying to Prestwick on Thursday,::&gt;Mr Trump will head straight straight toTurnberry in Ayrshire, for the unveiling of his revamped hoteland golf course the following day.&gtn Friday the real estate mogul will take part in the ceremonial cutting of the ribbon at the luxury resort,And::""On Friday the real estate mogul will take part in the ceremonial cutting of the ribbon at the luxury resort, that Mr says he has spent some m in refurbishing.""From that article. That is when he made the remark on Brexit, Friday was the th, the day after the vote.::The confusion seems to be due to time zones.Based on [this Tweet]() (assuming it is accurate) he left the US at roughly am on th June *UK time*, which would have been -9pm rd June *US time*. Direct commercial flights take -8 hours, so depending on how he travelled, he might have arrived in the UK just on rd June in the western parts of the US.At a guess, President Trump's press office said he'd be flying to Scotland on Thursday rd (which is true), and that got repeated by the UK press by without checking for time zones, and also got turned from ""leaving on rd"" to ""arriving on rd"" by mistake.::[deleted]::Find a better source than his tweet?Talking of sources, based on [this article]() Farage claimed victory at am, Galloway at roughly am, with projections of a Leave win beginning around am. The BBC and ITV called the election at roughly am. All of which would have been while President Trump was on the plane.Secondly, let's look at what he actually said, based on [this transcript]():&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.So it doesn't matter if he flew into the UK on rd (he didn't), or if technically the result hadn't been called when he arrived (it had been), because his claim was about opening the course the day before.So even if we take ""Brexit"" to be on th June (rather than the day of the vote) he was still wrong. He got his events in the wrong order.::He arrived in Scotland the rd and arrived in Turnball on the th and the referendum result was decided in early morning right? I guess he travels a lot so its not such an important point to make, and an easy mistake to make, and he did predict Brexit, but Jon does seem right here.::[deleted]::Seems most likely (based on [this tweet]()) he left the US on the rd US time, but on th UK time. Time zones are complicated.::[deleted]::It's just another of the many ""factual errors"" (or lies) he came up with in that press conference.I get that pointing out all his lies takes up enough time, but it helps remind us how untrustworthy and dishonest he is.::[deleted]::Quote:&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit ...He was not opening Turnberry the day before Brexit.The statement is a lie.::[deleted]::He said he was opening it the day before Brexit.Even being as charitable to him as possible, he was opening it on the day of Brexit.He lied.

rumoureval_268,DEBUNK THIS: We could not return to earth after the moon landing because we could not bring enough fuel/rockets to get back.,"You are on the right track. A few additional points : * The bulk of the mass (90% or more of total mass!) that you lift out of the gravity well, is in fact the fuel that you are using to lift you out of the gravity well. This is why rockets use stages, so they can abandon the empty tanks as soon as they are empty. * * See the fuel paradox section of this article As you said, the moon's gravity is much weaker, and wouldn't take that much to escape (1/6 of the cost of lifting that same mass from earth. And additionally, we were lifting much less mass from the moon than we lifted from earth)* * Added to that, for the actual moon landing, we only took enough fuel to get back into moon-orbit. All the rest of the fuel stayed in orbit around the moon for the trip back to earth.* * all the abandoned rocket stages on earth, all the fuel that had already been spent, the command module in moon orbit, the parts of the Lunar Module we left on the moon, the rover, etc was all mass we didn't have to move around the second time, making the fuel requirements cheaper.* The entire moon journey was in orbit around the earth. It took relatively little fuel to push us towards the moon, and then come back. Notably, had we missed the moon, we would have come back to earth automatically, without expending further fuel (although perhaps the astronauts would have run out of air first)* * This was used for practical effect in Apollo where they just did a trip around the moon and came back, because if they didn't actually have enough fuel to ""turn around"" at the time that the accident happened* * This type of logic was a major plot point in the book version of the Martian* During the trip to/from , spending additional fuel just gets you there faster, but every bit of fuel you spend speeding you up, you might also have to spend slowing you down again (absent using the gravity well for that purpose) - so they minimize the amount of fuel the actually use for the trip, and save it mostly for emergencies and course corrections. If it takes you days, or days probably isn't a big deal as long as you planned for it, and the additional cost/weight of the fuel to do it in days less is prohibitive). - So they figure out the acceptable mission length, and take enough fuel for that to work out.::Thanks so much for your answer! If you have knowledge of the 'ratio' of the fuel necessary to get to the moon (i.e. get out of the earth's gravity well) vs. the fuel needed to get a much smaller vehicle in and out of the moon-orbit and then back into the earth-orbit that takes it home, that would be very helpful Thanks for giving me further things to google though!::This image gives you quite a bit of the info basically the first and second stages are used entirely to get into earth orbit, and the third stage is for the moon and back : S1 : ~500k GallonsS2 : ~300k Gs3 : ~80k G Probably unaccounted for here is the fuel to lift off from the moon, which was in separate tanks for the lunar module, and would not be that much due to the low gravity of the moon, and the much lower amount of mass being lifted.::Thank you!::Another short debunk from a nerd's perspective: play kerbal space program, and one of the first things you do is figure out how to land on and return from the moon (or Mun in this case). The key observation is the amount of fuel needed to get your initial rocket into orbit, vs the amount to return your tiny escape capsule home. It's on the order of x as much.::I could show him, but he's not big on video games. Solid suggestion though!::YouTube videos of Kerbal gameplay might be good. Apollo reenactment is popular with players.Facts rarely work on such people, but archive.org has all the radio transmissions from the Apollo flights, including from on the way back to Earth. There's footage of reentry from inside the capsule too, but don't press too hard.This is about the maneuver to return to Earth, and the linked pages are also useful. was having fun looking things up, here's the original manual for the engine that got them home from the Moon:::Haha, glad you had fun!Yeah, I'm not going to push very hard, but it will come up sometime (it always does \^_\^), and then I can just casually whip out facts. He's sensitive to science based arguments; he works as a plumber, very defensive of his intelligence toward both of his uni educated kids. I'm not trying to prove him wrong, more trying to get him with the program, he's holding himself and his view of the world back by clinging to this theory. It (mildly) infuriates me, as he's not otherwise a conspiracy nut.And as with everyone else who contributed: thank you for helping me out!::I'd be hesitant to use that simply because it _is_ a game. Despite how accurate or analogous it may be, there's still the easy out of ""It's just a damn game, they can make it do whatever they want"".If anything, it might strengthen his belief in the conspiracy.::So much easier on kerbal space program also. The ratio is much higher as gravity is much lower::It won't help with your dad, but you will appreciate [Mitchell &amp; Webb's take on the issue.](). It nicely points out the absurdity of the issue.That is queued up for the moon landing video, but they actually made three in the series, so if you like it jump to the beginning of the video to see the others.::Yeah, love them, but sadly it has proven ineffective::Yeah, my mom is generally fairly level headed, but she is *absolutely* convinced that Diana was executed. I want to have her watch that video, but easier to just avoid the subject. On the grand scheme of conspiracies to believe, that is a relatively innocuous one.::Would be great if your Dad could come to Kennedy Space Center and see the sheer size of the Saturn rocket. You could then assure him one much smaller would be adequate if the landing were to be a one-way trip.::Who knows, might be a fun trip!::Per my answer, thats actually not really true. The vast majority of the rocket was just to get us into Earth orbit. It only costs a fraction of additional fuel to get to the moon and back once you make it into space.Thats why things like the space elevator, or space mining are so attractive, because if you start in space, or can get to space cheaply, moving around in space is already cheap.::Short Form Debunk: Well we did the moon landing so we must've gotten enough gas.::isn't that short form circular reasoning?::Yeah but it's not a hypothetical or a thought experiment, we know the answer, so we know the termination and thusly the deduction.::While I agree with you, I'm dealing with someone who does not accept that, so sadly no circular argument will do.::They're a moon hoaxer? They're aware that at the time it was impossible to hoax the moon landing?::All of this is in the OP. I'm specifically asking for the math/physics/engineering that is involved in getting back from the moon (he somehow has no problem grasping that the rocket left earth).While that's a nice video, it does not address my question (I get what you are saying, really, I do, but I've tried this argument before. Since he's hung up on the perceived impossibility of getting back, I'd rather present a solid argument that he's wrong in that regard).::sorry, reading reddit at work I must've not red your op at all my b::Thanks for trying to help anyway::I do wonder who he thinks Buzz Aldrin is tho::Some overhyped actor, probably xD",fake

rumoureval_323,"Debunk this: Nicotine isn't really bad for you, and it's the other substances that makes tobacco so harmful.","Actually, he is right, kind of. Though nicotine can have bad side effects in excess (as almost all drugs, including caffeine) and is very addictive (roughly as addictive as morphine) the main health problems associated with smoking concern the build up of carcinogens and various oxidants that cause a myriad of physiological damage that would take me a few hours to type out comprehensively. Nicotine itself is not considered carcinogenic, which is why nicotine therapies (like a patch) are favored over cigarette use. It gives the person the nicotine fix (albeit, less effective than inhaling) without loading down your body with the huge list of added chemicals in cigarettes. Is nicotine good for you? No, its not. It can cause hypertension, birth problems, and a few other minor problems. However, caffeine and ethanol are both ""not good"" for you in most contexts, and its all about weighing out their potential health risks with whatever value we place on their psychoactive effects. It is absolutely true, though, that cigarettes carry with them a lot of baggage that causes many of the health problems associated with smoking, and the only reason people smoke is because of nicotine, so in that sense it is the ""worst"" thing in a cig.Just to add some primary literature to this, here is an excerpt from Uptodate, which is paid access so you cannot see it.&gt;NICOTINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK Smoking is an important and established risk for myocardial infarction and other coronary events, including angina pectoris [11-13]. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex. The main responsible constituents are combustion products, including oxidizing chemicals, acrolein, butadiene, metals (such as cadmium), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulates, and carbon monoxide. Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals, increase lipid peroxidation, and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of LDL, and platelet activation.Nicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events. There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctionAlso, wikipedia has alot of this information.Now, your friend may think an e cig is absolutely safe. This is a dubious claim, since, not only does nicotine have some negative side effects, but the current regulations on e cigs are effectively non-existent. This means their may be some other various chemicals that make them unsafe. They are a fairly new thing so research is insufficient. My personal opinion is that they are definitely more safe than cigarettes, less safe than nothing at all, but a potentially excellent smoking cessation therapy option that could get people to stop smoking.::Any decent e-cig has a silica wick than can't burn, and nicotine juice is pretty simple stuff, some ratio or another of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin nicotine and some flavorings. Not much you can cut corners on and still get decent ""smoke."" Propylene glycol has a pretty good body of research saying it's harmless in the quantities you could possibly be smoking, it's used for medical vaporizers. Vegetable glycerin I'm admittedly not so sure of, but so far as I know there's no known issues caused by vaporizing it. I suppose the various flavorings added could theoretically cause issues, it's hard to say exactly what they're made of. That said, I'd put a good amount of money on most people having zero or negligible health impact from the non-nicotine components of e-cig juice. Unless you're smoking those sketchy cheapo things they sell at gas stations.::A straight forward cigarette has minimal ingredients but the tobacco companies have added many things to increase their addictiveness and lethality. The same can easily be done for e-cigs. I don't think it has yet but it certainly can be.::Those of us that vape shop from companies that self regulate, though I agree that regulation is a good thing, but over-regulation like the FDA is proposing will effectively kill off the majority of manufacturers and vendors.Peer reviewed studies, a lot of them, showing that ecigs are of minimal to no health concern: nicotine is not as addictive as you make it out to be, tobacco is. The reason is that tobacco contains both nicotine and natural Monoamine Oxidaise Inhibitors (MAOI's). Here are a few studies on this subject:::The nicotine damages your heart and blood vessels by causing high blood pressure, but not your lungs. The tar and smoke are what destroys your lungs. But since nicotine is the addictive element in cigarettes, one might argue that it indirectly damages your lungs by getting you hooked on the idea of pumping tar and smoke into your lungs.::&gt;He compared nicotine to caffeine.Not at all comparible.",fake

If Gladstone isn't safe, then we should simply pull down every statue just in case. This is the 'snobbery of chronology' - Tim Farron","OK how many students are campaigning for this?And how many students are at the university of Liverpool::I'm actually a student at UOL, although currently on a year out. First I've heard of this. There's a system online where you can submit proposals to the guild, and it was used to get the Myanmar leader (initials ASK, don't remember her name) removed over the royhinga massacre, but it's usually worthless suggestions. Around exams there was a popular suggestion to get a room of puppies to destress, and there was a popular proposal to ban meat on mondays to promote veganism. Those ""popular"" suggestions had around votes up out of a student body of k. I can guarantee that the vast majority of the student body does not give a fuck.::I was also a student at University of Liverpool a couple of years ago. I can confirm that most students weren't interested in campus politics, and that it was usually the same few dozen people who were involved in campaigns.::is this not true of all student politics?::My Uni (Cardiff) boasted about a % turnout.::Jeez, I guess the -20% turnout for our uni-wide elections isn't so bad then. College elections within the uni tend to be much higher turnout, but when there's only -800 students voting, it actually makes a difference both in voting and in policy.::% is the second highest ever. % is the record, very long standing too. Cardiff Uni elections are the entire university and this was for electing a bunch of officers to the Welsh and National whatever they call the big get togethers. I think most positions were one candidate standing too.::I think we had ~15% for an NUS disaffiliation referendum, which was narrowly to stay in. There was a similar turnout for a referendum to do with publication of results. It would have been higher, but the SU had completely failed to properly define what the result was for.::It's probably because college unions seem much more relatable - I've tended to see my college union president on close to a daily basis since we actually know each other, as well as some others involved in the union, and I've often heard from him about (or had input on) various bits of policy. Meanwhile, the only interaction with the uni-wide union is through an email nobody reads anyway. Plus since they're not directly responsible for student welfare etc. (that's the job of college unions) the work they do is also much less relatable. However the fact that college union elections have a high turnout possibly increases turnout in uni-wide elections a little.::Yep. Central union makes meaningless, waving statements; the JCRs and MCRs campaign to get better beer on tap at the college bar. I know which one makes more of a difference in my life.::I think more right wing media sources are interested in student politics than students themselves as a way to make lurid claims and put evil left wing in the headline. Especially atm it seems every story is 'Labour ^^^^voting ^^^^students ^^^^propose **to ban** Shakespeare/The Queen/Christmas/Heterosexuality!'. I've got a lot of problems with the left-wing especially the fucking tankie types you only ever see at university but atm it seems like this is the replacement attack line for Labour now the IRA/Muslim/Satan innuendo failed.::&gt; I think more right wing media sources are interested in student politics than students themselves as a way to make lurid claims and put evil left wing in the headline. To be fair if they're removing things based on a small number of people then people are right to be worried.::This is exactly right. An attempt at starting a moral panic using a few useful idiots. And they *are* useful idiots, and salt we have video proof of them existing::The thing is you can't just ignore things like this. This brand of movement leeches off its association with genuine movements for social justice and is therefore a bit seductive. If you ignore it then it can gather momentum unchecked and before you know it the history-rewriters are winning by default.::&gt; The thing is you can't just ignore things like this. Yes, you can, because everyone else does.::You can and probably should, but student politicians often become real politicians. Then they can push their ideas on the rest of society, and be supported again by low turnout::Anyone could staff % of the student council with hand-picked candidates with just a few well-placed bribes and promises. No one cares to do it, because the resources it grants access to are laughable. It's mainly the batshit ideological crusaders who find value in student politics. Real politics are a completely different league, with completely different motivations and players. The brainwashed crazies don't make it far there. Too inflexible to compromise and to adapt to practical necessities.::The only student politician of any real note who I can think of who went into actual adult politics is Wes Streeting, and he's hardly Mr Marxist McLeftie.::What are you on about? Half our MPs were heavily involved in student politics. How do you think we get our MPs in the first place? They join the Labour and Tory youth wings while still in uni, most of the time, and the political party wings in universities are usually strongly involved in student politics.::Tim Farron was a student politician, the former Lib Dem leader lol.::Along with a lot of important things that came about with left-wing politics in the s there was crazy suggestions that they used to denigrate the whole group.People just love to pretend a group of students making a point are a worry.::Probably, but I've only attended one university, so I'm only commenting on that one.::I couldnt figure out how to get into the student politics when I was at uni. Seemed every facet of university life was hard to decipher when you dont have any friends.::They had a poster about how much stuff had happened in the guild and the amount of votes for elections versus the amount of pints and burritos bought was pretty amusing.::&gtinitials ASK, don't remember her name)Aung San Suu Kyi::It sounds a bit like when I was at UKC, no one really cares about student politics or listens to the suggestions. The mandate for successful candidates was very small, and no one was really sure what the leadership team did.Pretty much every year the conservative society would submit plans for a ft Thatcher statue and get them to quite an advanced level. It sort of just highlighted the weirdness that is student politics and how anything can be permitted so long as more than people put their minds to it.::I know the QMU at Glasgow Uni does the whole bringing in puppies around exam time thing (and possibly the Meat Free Mondays as well). Seems to go down well!::Those are actually not entirely terrible ideas that have been implemented elsewhere.::If the link below is accurate, four students initially proposed the removal of Gladstone's name.

I just asked her and she knows nothing about this.::I wonder if this is an indictment on the death of student life at universities in an age where more students are juggling study and work, and where the traditional student institutions are dying from cuts whilst universities themselves are focussing more on marketing and selling than on being universities.Who knows?::[More than , according to this article.]()&gt; More than students have now backed the campaign on the Liverpool Guild of Students website.&gt; Student union president Sean Turner said an upcoming meeting would discuss whether to back the campaign next week because of the **volume of student support**.::I'm at UoL right now, and if not for reddit I wouldn't of even of heard of this. None of my flatmates had heard of it either, two of which are studying politics.::TIL the Guardian have an entire series of articles called [""students in a postcolonial world""]()::Let me guess, they don't buy newspapers, and read the Guardian with adblockers on?::My hatred for Adblock is only beaten to a photo finish by the more abusive ads on the internet. And I know I'm in the minority.::adblock is excellent, you must be ''employed"".::You mean, as a journalist or writer and whatnot? Not anymore, no.::as a musician and sound engineer, i learned of the disruptiveness of technology twenty years ago.::adblock has made Youtube bearable for me::I'd care less about YouTube ads if they didn't show me the same ads constantly. Seriously TUI, I am not going on holiday anytime soon. YouTube also once thought I'd like to see an ad in Russian, which was a waste of everyone's time.::Most of the Internet is a UX eldritch abomination without an adblocker these days. Its a shame its the only way to make money on the internet without charging the user at the moment, although part of me hopes that webassembly will make in-browser crypto mining a viable alternative one day. Theres just very few ways of serving ads that arent obnoxious and still profitable. Anything that covers the content or scrolls with you can go and spontaneously combust as far as Im concerned.::I don't know what the different ads generate but those can certainly wither away and die. I think something that compounds it is that more people are using their phones for the reading online. Even a -6 inch screen is not going to look appealing when you have cookie notices or banners that follow you.::Just out of curiosity, why do you have a hatred for adblock?::It is the other side of the coin that damages news, journalism and other media. Adblock and advertisers are in an arms race. I know adverts were getting ridiculous before Adblock but there are better ways to get websites to change their ways. If you use Adblock that's fine but if you use Adblock *and* complain about the state of online journalism etc., you're taking a liberty. And before it gets mentioned, sure, improving the funding of journalism is not a panacea for fixing the problems within journalism. E. Some people have expressed a vehement dislike of advertising, without any nuance. For those, I would just like you to consider one question: where did you find out/learn about Adblock, through advertising or word of mouth (another form of advertising)? Also, consider all the safety and charity advertising that has been beneficial to society.::That's historical-revisionism. AdBlock caught on because ads became unbearably intrusive and filled with malware. It wasn't the other way around.::You missed the arms race part. I never said Adblock came first, but are you trying to say that Adblock and other programmes have not been trying to block new strategies from advertisers? Malware? I've never gotten that from an advertiser. Where were those ads used?::Read the wikipedia link /u/hunnensturm posted for a quick primer.Malware has been spread across an enormous amount of otherwise large trusted sites and services like the NYT, Spotify, Facebook, Yahoo, Bing, and even across Google's ad network (i.e. half the sites on the internet). It's one of the faster growing attack vectors in recent years.If you don't run an ad blocker and disable third party domain scripts / frames by default these days, it's increasingly likely you will be (or have already been) exposed to malware. It's exactly like fucking around without a condom, sooner or later you'll get the digital clap.Many users also never even realise they've been compromised unless the payload is intentionally overt in nature, such as ransomware. Spyware, RATs / trojans, miners and botnet clients only have any benefit to the attacker when they hide their processes from the user.Sure, going to warez and porn sites obviously increases the risk but there's no such thing as ""safe sites"" to stick to. The vast majority of online businesses who deploy adverts contract it out entirely to agencies who often totally fail to do any serious due diligence on the specific content they are serving up to their clients. And that's the agencies which aren't outright malicious themselves.The only realistic solution is for more people to buy subs from outlets they want to support, I have several myself. But that's also not feasible for everyone. Just because they can't afford to do so, it doesn't mean they should expose their identities, personal data, and finances to attack.::Mostly on the dodgy side of the web (download sites and links), although every so often a website gets hacked and does it to their viewers. I keep it around for the bad stuff and unblock most news media I go to myself.::Your argument is like the argument for vegetarianism/ veganism; I know you're right, but I'm just not quite ready to make the leap yet. I guess I could start by being more conscientious about whitelisting the good websites.::That's fair enough. I'm not here to defend the whole advertising industry or news/media sites. Just to throw my opinion into the fray.::That's actually the best argument against adblockers that I've heard. Personally, I have one on by default, but whitelist every site that I use frequently, mainly just to avoid over-the-top popups. It's unfortunate that there's not really a nice way to improve the way online journalism is monetised - paywalls are probably more annoying than ads.::[deleted]::You mean, ""further down the toilet"" , surely.::I think it's their social commentary side that's a bit shit, really. Their actual news articles are generally well written and informative, if a little ""this is what you should think"" for my taste. But all newspapers try to tell you what to think, rather than just report the news. Having said that I don't read newspapers often, so what do I know?::It's always funny to see Pakistani/Bangladeshi/African Muslims crying about 'European colonialism' when they follow an Arab religion forced on their ancestors by the biggest colonialists of all. If they really cared instead of just pushing an intolerant hateful anti-Western agenda they'd become atheists.::No the biggest colonialists were definitely the Europeans, England most of all.::The biggest colonies belonged to Europeans but any expansionist nation would have jumped at the chance to become a global power, so in terms of ambition I don't think you can criticise Europe for doing anything other cultures would have done if they had the opportunity.::Why should I feel guilty just because my ancestors - and probably not even my direct ancestors as I doubt I'm descended from anyone rich enough to own slaves - were better at being cunts/got more lucky than the rest of the world?::Ottoman empire doesn't real.::Caliphate doesn't into persia?::Ottoman Empire's peak population in the th century, by the start of WWI. At the start of WWI, the British Empire had colonial subjects, while France has colonial subjects.Jesus fucking Christ, comparing the Ottoman Empire to the British Empire is like comparing Taiwan to China.::This is some bullshit. What degree of control did the British empire have on an Indian farmer living in an Indian princely state in WW1? Meanwhile Ottomans literally took the first born child of Christians living within the empire as soldiers. You cannot go by just numbers, which are misleading anyway.::We went so far as to break their fingers so that they couldn't perform skilled labour and relied on us for pretty much everything. I think that marks a pretty strong degree of control.::Depends how you define it. I think Malaysians and Indonesians and Nigerians and Kenyans to this day worshiping an Arab god and doing their sermon in an Arabic language is a pretty strong sign of their colonial imprint.::The Mongols, Zulus and Ottomans would like a word::That's proselytising though, not organised annexation and settlement.::I don't think it's liberalism eating itself, I think it's liberals failing to vocally stand against these nutters who aren't liberal::A fairly longstanding failure of theirs then to be honest::well, we need the nutters. when theres a major issue we can round them up and use them as the stick to our carrot. like the sufferagettes and the sufferagists. the polite, reasonable, moderate ones were ignored so the radicals took off and started putting bricks through windows, blowing up letterboxes and chaining themselves to fences.::So tearing down a statue of Gladstone is just like that?::sadly they go off and do their own thing instead of just hibernating as we would have hoped.::The issue with left wing nutters is that they're here there and everywhere.Whereas right wing nutters almost invariably have the same agenda; race centered fascism, the lefties have myriad impossible missions including breaking up banking institutions, radical anarchism, communism, animal rights, meaningful tax reform etc...Getting that crazy bunch to form a coherent, united opinion on something is like herding cats.::It's more a core issue of identity politics - the more fanatic elements of any grouping are going to perform actions that the majority either aren't that fussed about one way or the other, they're content to believe that despite sharing an identity that they can be distinguished from the crazies, or they're weakly in favour of the actions (but not enough to bestir themselves).You see it with Muslims and Muslim extremists, Christian fundamentalists, Tories, Labour, etc. Even bloody football teams.It means if you identify with pretty much any group beyond a certain size, the most identifible parts of the group will skew further and further to the extremes as time goes on, leaving all members of that group tainted by association.::As a liberal I never heard about about this until just just now. Thank god there are conservatives monitoring every student publication, no matter how obscure so that we can denounce these subversives.::Did a dozen students put forward a daft motion at a university? *To the presses! The world must know! The downfall of* The Left *is here!*It's very easy to put a motion forward at a student union. It's as newsworthy as a change.org petition with signatures. Similarly nobody actually looks into or cares much about leadership candidates, you just read their statement on the website and vote based on that (if you give enough of a fuck to even do that). You don't know who they are, they don't have a track record or a party they represent so it's very easy for someone unsuited to the task to get the job.::Ah yes, the mythical species of the Silent Majority Liberal Who Is Actually Liberal But Who Doesn't Care Enough.::I don't know about majority, but I think they are afraid of being vocal because it will look like they are on the side of right wing or even far-right people. They care more about their own image essentially::So their angle is that Gladstone helped gain the equivalent of m in today's money as compensation for slave owners.If that's how low the bar is then just remove every name. I'm sympathetic to elements of these campaigns but this example is just absurd. There's always an element who push something to the Nth degree, which allow opponents to point and them and discredit the whole thing.Every single politician is going to fall short of that standard. Every single politician has voted for something 'problematic' which means they shouldn't be celebrated. The fact is it's not even that they feel this is in some way damaging or a mark on history [Rhodes Must Fall in SA], it's being stuck in a uni where you can't be organising some great protest so making do.The tinfoil part of me thinks nonsense protests like this only make the news in the first place to tar the whole movement with its fringe.::Also pretty much everyone who was alive before the turn of the s was likely a little bit racist or prejudiced or profited from 'bad things' by modern standards. Not just politicians, everyone.Leaders of emancipations, uprisings, all the people from history that have made a name for themselves are likely immoral/bad/hateful by the standards of today.::Case in point: Gandhi was a massive racist. He hated black people. And a possible paedophile. His statues are still up, because they celebrate what he did for India. The statues aren't there to celebrate the fact he was a racist or nonced his cousin.::Wasn't he also a uber hindu nationalist wanting to suppress the other religions of the Raj?::Quite the contrary actually, he was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist who felt he was making too many concessions to the Muslim minority.::&gt their angle is that Gladstone helped gain the equivalent of m in today's money as compensation for slave owners.There were only two ways to abolish slavery: compensate teh slave owners, or go to war.The first was cheaper all round in terms of money and lives (including the lives of slaves).The alternative was not to bother at all, and you could argue that if the British Empire had not abolished slavery, no-one would, because we put massive pressure on the slaving nations once we abolished (both in terms of peer pressure, and in actually capturing ships and releasing slaves). Even with our best efforts places like Brazil didn't abolish slavery till the 's.::And slavery in England has been banned for over a thousand years now.::Huh?::Without getting into whether students have a point in protesting the name of this residence hall, I looked it up for the sake of scratching my personal historian's itch. The m quoted in the BBC video is only the sum Gladstone's father obtained in slave compensation. And the student in the video actually underestimates the amount, because [I read here]() that m is a better estimate of what k pounds would buy today: &gt; Gladstone's father was a slave owner; in , when slavery was abolished, he helped his father obtain (equivalent to relative to average salary, in purchasing power terms, in ): Gladstone's father was just one of many slave owners that received compensation. In total, [the British government paid m in as compensation to slave owners](), which would be the modern equivalent of between bn and bn if one multiplies by . I remember some historians writing that this *partly* explains why the industrial revolution started earlier in the UK than in continental Europe, because this created a group of people that looked for new productive avenues to invest this windfall in.::Rhodes Must Fall is an idiotic movement, led by black power idiots and a smaller collection of left wing virtue signalling cling-ons.::This sounds to me a lot like some kiddy Corbyn types desperately trying to find their own 'Rhodes Must Fall' issue to make a fuss over, struggling to find an applicable one, and so instead going after a celebrated liberal reformer and supporter of home rule for Ireland.::Does anyone else just not care? If I was on campus and you asked me, I'd say ""eh I don't think you have to, but if you want to go for It"".::A lot of people don't care. In a way that's a problem though, because such apathy could easily result in the wholesale hollowing of our connection to the past.There is a value in keeping things the same. It's not a monetary or ethical value so it's hard to argue for - it's just that there's something fundamentally pleasant, comforting and enriching about having a street name remain the same for hundreds of years. It's not a big value, at least not individually - no-one is experiencing ecstasy from the mere knowledge that that statue in the park has been there for ages and memorialises someone important, but if you add up all the millions of tiny bits of niceness this produces it's actually quite important, I think.Sometimes there's a good reason to change a name or pull down a statue or make other changes. Actually they happen all the time. But this is a really shit reason, because naming something after someone or having a statue of them doesn't mean you approve of everything they did or believed. Not even remotely. This is such a weird misunderstanding that I find it hard to understand.But the problem is that it's a seductive argument: so-and-so did something bad, so we shouldn't honour them. And changing this name isn't such a big deal so why not do it? ""Eh"" everybody says, ""I guess that *is* bad, and I guess it *isn't* such a big deal. So who cares?""Well I think everyone should care because the underlying principle, if carried out consistently, would actually be very bad because of its cumulative effect.::We have books and things. The connection to the past does not purely rest on people's names on buildings or statues or plaques. That value in keeping things the same is something I simply do not see. This is why I'm so surprised because people are up in arms about something that, at least from my point of view, affects nothing and harms no one. Most people didn't care what it was called then, and if it doesn't go through, most people won't care what it's called afterwards. These people do, so accommodate them where you can.RE the ""misunderstanding"": naming something or building a statue does imply endorsement. No one puts villains on buildings.::my response more or less. ""i dont care what you call the place, just let me go to class.""::They should call it the Liverpool Institute of Binge Drinking. Should make everyone happy.::i wont say i agree but....::[BBC link in tweet.]()::It always makes me cringe when this sort of American import rears its head over here.British students feeling left out of the next great social justice movement scramble to find something to be outraged about.::It was going on here nearly two years ago.::In the end, wasn't the Rhodes discussion from one or two South African students who wanted (and got) free publicity for their future in politics::Wasnt one a Rhodes scholar too?::Yes. He was also a colossal twat which is why the campaign sort of died away.::The biggest American import ITT is calling left-wing people Liberals.::Its almost like there are a load of Americans in this sub pushing some kind of agenda but not knowing how to change their talking points...::This isn't an American import nor a similar situation. The issue in America is about statues and monuments that were built during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights eras as an intimidation tactic.::&gt; social justice movement Why do I feel you actually think of social justice as a bad thing?::I don't know, why do you feel that? Please elaborate. I mean you're utterly wrong unless your idea of social justice is pointless gesture politics such as removing a name from a building.::What is social justice to you?::Because its impossible to achieve and the efforts made to actually achieve it (i.e. positive discrimination etc.) cause more social ills than they solve::It's not impossible to achieve improvements, even if it is impossible to achieve some platonic model of perfection. It wasn't impossible to get women the right to vote, and it didn't cause more social ills than it solved. It wasn't impossible to ban racist discrimination and many instances, and it didn't cause more problems than it solved. It wasn't impossible to ban religious persecution and discrimination, and it didn't cause more problems than it solved. It wasn't impossible to outlaw homophobic bigotry and many instances, nor legalise gay marriage, and it didn't cause more problems than it solved.We're hardly at the end of the road, here, but looking back all I can see is an excellent track record of success after success after success.::Lets all sit on our hands and do nothing then?::That's not what I said, I just said wasting government resources on an abstract goal of ""social justice"" harms more than it helps.::&gt; wasting government resources on an abstract goal of ""social justice"" harms more than it helpsThere's a reason most people hate ""diversity"" when really people should like it. They made it into a dirty word, they made it into an anti-white and anti-male word and that's the first thing I think of when someone says it.::And so the long stream of victories of political activism against racism, sexism, homophobia, etc were... fake? Useless?::No, my point is trying to achieve a Rawlsian sense of perfect social justice is impossible. best you can get is equality before the law, if you aim for more you harm more than help. Society will always be unequal in some places due to the natural distribution of goods (i.e. intelligence or height) - it's impossible to aim for more::&gt; it's impossible to aim for more... completely ignoring...&gt;the long stream of victories of political activism against racism, sexism, homophobia, etc::You're not reading what I posted mate. I said the best you can get is ""equality before the law"". The long stream of victories you refer to against racism, sexism, homophobia etc. all contributed toward that. They were indispensable and necessary. Now that it's been achieved, further implementations are unnecessary and hurt more than they harm. Positive discrimination is a perfect example, or blacklisting certain candidates because of their sex, race, class etc. I wanted to apply for an internship at the Foreign Office because I study International Relations and wanted to get a taste of what its like. I went onto their website and found that to even apply for the internship you have to be a) a woman b) socioeconomically disadvantaged c) a minority or d) disabled. My personality, grades or competency is completely irrelevant. Ironically enough, the laws on discrimination actually had to be changed to make stuff like this legal again.::&gt;Now that it's been achieved, further implementations are unnecessary and hurt more than they harmI'm certain that was said after every victory you've just listed though.::Well while I am sure this is a vocal minority we need to stop judging people of the past by the standards of today. It's totally unfair and even the most forward looking person today will be seen as a dinosaur by their th century counterpart.::Maybe we should stop pretending that vocal minorities represent anyone but themselves,::I hear Cesar had slaves erase him from history! what did the roman's ever do for us anyway?::What do you mean by 'erase from history' and how would this count as it?::I mean that for me its better to keep a statue or building named after something that by today's standards is unacceptable, Absolutely make the history and situation around it widely known maybe even erect a plaque nearby to raise awareness.But to start retroactively ripping things down for today's short term problems does a disservice to future generations and risks losing the lessons of history.::Another yesterday's man desperate for attention. No-one gave a crap when he was party leader which is fair enough, all he ever talked about was his mum, and now he's resorted to this. Student politics is ""liberalism eating itself"", grow up.Twitter is good for breaking news and allsorts I suppose but I really don't care what opinions hasbeens can shart out in characters.::From personal experience, any political movements that stem from Universities are cancerous, the amount of marxist stuff we have where I am is somewhat concerning.::This has zilch to do with Gladstone and everything to do with the power of revising history and exerting political will over people. If it weren't Gladstone it'd be someone else, right up until we're disavowing Churchill for being an Islamophobe or the Queen for not doing enough for civil rights in the s. It's a never ending game.The goal is to deconstruct British identity. You start with the easy ones that leverage people's guilt and then work on from there.It's moronic, and it's going to lead to even more political division and siloing of communities until eventually push comes to shove and we end up with some kind of totalitarian government.You stop this by not playing their stupid, stupid games but frankly it seems too late for that.::a handful of fringe students with no political, no economic, and limited cultural power are gong to deconstruct British identity. Right::Backed by the BBC.::They're doing their bit, unwittingly::Churchill was a massive dickhead, though.::He also stood up against a Genocidal maniac who offered him a peace deal in his favour. look at only the bad and youre just gonna see a bad person.::&gt; Churchill was a massive dickhead, though.he was amazingly funny if you werent the butt of the joke.::Oh boy, didn't you get the memo that Reddit *hates* Churchill now? find the permanently self-righteously outraged on the internet quite astonishing. It takes a special kind of arrogance and ignorance. They'll turn on their own in an instant - see this J.K. Rowling thing.Churchill said some awful things, and made some questionable decisions in wartime. He also, er, played a vital role in preventing the fall of Britain to the Nazis.::A few million dead Bengalis is kind of a big deal::Yeah, you've got a point - Churchill had them systematically removed from their homes, shipped to death camps and slaughtered by gassing.::You don't have to be as bad as Hitler to be a dickhead yaknow::Point is it's possible to celebrate a person as a hero without believing they're perfect, or even that good overall. Churchill delivered the country from an existential threat the likes of which we hadn't seen for centuries and haven't seen since. He could have raped puppies and we'd probably still be celebrating him.::So you would apply this same critique to Joseph Stalin?::It's difficult to say since he was never any kind of hero to us in the UK. We remember him as a tyrant first and foremost so of course we aren't going to want to memorialise him here.I don't mean to suggest that Churchill could literally have done anything and it would still be a good idea to have statues of him, but that it's not like the fact that he did bad stuff is going to diminish our desire to remember him.::I know quite a lot of Muslims who are involved in this campaign, and other campaigns like it across the country.People who see Muhammad as a perfect human being and role model.Peak hypocrisy.::If you are campaigning for this then you're not a liberal. You're trying to re-write history and that makes you an authoritarian.::Nonsense, its not like he's being scrubbed from the history books.In fact I'd say fixing the opinion of historical figures is more damaging to the study of history than letting opinions change with time.::It's fucking student politics who cares?::The easily offended.::Also the non-students who want to attack uni students.::To be fair, the few dozen people at the University who care about this will seem like a much bigger number to the person who was leader of the LDs at the last GE.::Its the same sort of students that try this year in and year out. When I was at UoL there were campaigners trying to rename Penny Lane for gods sake. It really is the X Factor mentality. ""IF I DISLIKE SOMETHING, I CAN VOTE TO GET RID OF IT"". I guarantee these students know very little of Gladstone.::The left eating itself? fuck off you cunt you sold out the leftist uni student to the tories on false promises and bullshit a few years ago::I hate Gladstone, and even I think this is nonsense of the highest order. These people want to destroy Western Cultural History to make us feel ashamed of ourselves. Disgusting.::I don't really have a problem with this tbh (not that I care that much) its perfectly reasonable for people to not want their institutions to continue to be named after people who had links to slavery and other such nastiness.Remember, the only reason a lot of these buildings are named after people are because they provided grants/donations. Not for anything actually important.Also I don't buy that ""we should pull down every statue"", there are plenty of historical figures who aren't dodgy.::This case in itself is not important but its a sign of a dying society.::&gt; but its a sign of a dying society.A handful of people at a uni makes some noise about an issue.'society is dying'Society's taking a long time dying if that's the case.::Well, if society is dying it wouldn't exactly be a quick process would it? He's not suggesting its something that happens overnight.::People have been sobbing that 'society is dying' for hundreds and hundreds of years - it certainly has been an extremely slow process. It's not much different than people complaining about how the younger generation are so awful. The OP is just being a drama queen.::&gt; People have been sobbing that 'society is dying' for hundreds and hundreds of yearsAnd plenty of societies have died in the last several hundred years. What's your point?::I'm not saying it is dying, just that if it was it would be a slow process that wouldn't be obvious or apparent at the time. Also, just because people have said something for a long time doesn't mean they're always going to be wrong. For example it might have started dying in , in a process that's going to take years, that will only be properly recognized after years. Whatever anyone has been sobbing for however long before that has zero bearing on whether that's actually the case or not. People have been saying the world will end since people have been around, and we know it will one day end, so its pretty ridiculous to suggest that just because people have been incorrectly saying something will happen means that thing won't ever happen.::the decline of rome took at least a century. the decline of the byzantines even longer. the ottomans were 'the sick man of europe' for a couple of centires before they finally broke up.::Do you not think a gent teleported from Victorian England might bemoan the lack of hats, polite greetings, formal clothing and the fact that everyone is staring at and rubbing a small glowing tile.::No it's not.

The more products and services they offer, the more publicity they get, and you remember the brand more.::YouTube accounted for about percent of Google's $66 billion in revenue during they say thet don't make profit but do you see all the ads,they also only pay little for content,most people put it on for free::yes but revenue and profit are different youtube still apparently is not turning over any profit for google it wouldn't matter if youtube counted for % or % of revenue if it makes no profit::google does not admit to profit::Google's spin-off benefits from owning YouTube include the accumulation of our data and strengthening of their network design -- and the more time people spend watching online video, the more advertisers will pour into marketing on the internet as a whole. There's no doubt that Google can afford YouTube."" McMahon also believes that by keeping quiet about YouTube's hidden benefits and by allowing the misconception of it as a deeply unprofitable business to circulate, things work very nicely in Google's favour when it comes to negotiating with copyright holders in the world of TV, movies and music. Copyright holders can't demand money that isn't there, and it would certainly take no more than a hint of profitability at YouTube for lawyers to descend, threatening court cases and demanding higher royalties. In the new, topsy-turvy world of online economics, it seems astonishing that losses on paper have actually made YouTube a more powerful online force. This leaves out another point as well: the more that people believe YouTube is unprofitable, the less likely they are to build serious competitors. I have no idea whether or not YouTube is actually profitable directly yet (I'd doubt it), but I think those who are insisting that the acquisition by Google was a bad idea, or that YouTube is somehow on its deathbed, haven't taken much time to understand some basic trendlines or the larger picture of how Google views YouTube, and the opportunities it has to make money via YouTube down the road.",real

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/conspiracy) if you have any questions or concerns.*::Huge theories looking into this. I am extemely fascinated in them, however the Egyptians in control of this research are too afraid to look into it and completely shut down any westerner telling them what these things couldve been.i can never understand how as a species at this point we still choose to hold information back from others. This is shit we couldve already been past.there is also alot of plausible reaserch in this (ie tesla but we all know how that went). it seems like they are scared of the fact that past humans couldve had the same knowledge or better about certain things. people cant fathom us not being the pinnacle.::I think its moreso they have their whole career and teaching vested in what they thought was right, and ego gets in the way of admitting they could be wrong. Science is politics.::Pride begins the fall.::Graham Hancock believes that the pyramids are created by Humans itself but by different civilization for a different purpose (not tomb). Carbon dating suggests that the pyramid itself is older and will not fit on the mainstream history timeline.Agree with holding back information is a dead ass roadblock on finding out the truth. Human behaviour is just so chaotic and uniformity i believe will never be achieved.::&gt; Graham HancockDid Hancock ""theorize"" that the Pyramids were a power source or something to that effect in Finger Prints of the Gods? I know I was reading about that idea + years ago.::The ""Giza Power Plant"" book by Christopher Dunn came out in . Hancock's site has an article written by Dunn :::Regardless of Chris Dunn's ideas on what the pyramid was for, he details highly intriguing findings on the granite sarcophagus within the King's Chamber, which tests for perfect flatness on all four walls and floor within, by machining standards. He's posted photographs of himself using a precision flatbar and a flashlight to prove this. How on Earth ancient peoples obtained flatness on stone finer than /10,000ths of an inch is certainly something that leaves me scratching my head. The sarcophagus walls are also perfectly parallel from the ground up, which is extremely impressive given that it was carved from a single block of granite.::Im not sure about it being originally his idea but i do believe he mentions the theory in Fingerprints.::Does he tend to promote his own ideas? Could be wrong but it seemed like he's generally sharing the information/stories he collects. He weaved allot together, but my memory suggests he was only connecting existing information. Maybe I'm completely wrong. Fingerprints is won of those books that was such a perspective changing experience I can't be certain.::He wants to sell books, but is learned in his field. One of the reasons new information cannot be gained in Egyptology is the strict embargo.::He promotes his own ideas regarding spirituality, but not in a way to sell you something (even though he does have a book regarding it). I had the pleasure of meeting him once and we had a nice conversation about it. Hes a complete gentleman.::Carbon dating the Rock will place it at millions of years old, because that's how old rock is::Exactly - they're really only able to date it based on materials they find nearby and making an educated guess. I think the water erosion they found on the Sphinx indicated that it was much older as it must have happened before the area was so arrid- and they have a general timeline for that sort of thing? Not sure if the water erosion observations apply to the pyramids. Anyway that's what I recall.::I was under the impression that there has never been a sarcophagus found in any of the great pyramids, so who thinks they're tombs?Oh and about Hancock, I think he's full of shit to sell books, but he's still not as bad as Hawass.::Sarcophagi have been found, but never a mummy or a body.::It's technology that the very top has and controls, and they don't want the common man to get access to it.::Just imagine what it could do with the solid gold capstone still on it.

I dont think humanity has forgotten about that::But it does more!::Why do you think alchemy was ever a thing? Wanting to transmute matter into gold.::Thats not what true alchemy was aboutAlso the original capstone was a special conductive granite later replaced with a gold capstone and later again stolen because gold.::&gt; Wanting to transmute matter into wealth.::But why gold?::Gold is very soft and melts easy making it easy to work with and make fine crafts and jewelery out of as well as currency. It can also easily be verified for authenticity with a simple bite which is why you see pirates in old movies bite coins and look for marks. The shiny texture and Brite color is rare in geology making it sought after.::...yes, that is indeed the current accepted reasoning. Im implying that its for a different, much deeper reason. How did all civilizations complete separated in space and time come to attach value to gold? Why did some civilizations mine and collect gold, without understanding its uses or potential value? Why specifically gold, and not one of the many other shiny precious metals? How did one become so universally sought after?*Hint: the answer wont be found in a history book or on Wikipedia*::Is it that hard to understand? People would wander around looking at brown dirt and grey rocks and one day they saw gold! The first shiny rock! Sweet this is way better than that black rock or the red Rock and look I can even form it into shapes I like easy and it won't break like stupid green rocks or pearl rocks!! This shiny rock is awesome! I'll call it gold!!That same discovery happened all over the world by various tribes of men in the same organic manner except for maybe native Americans who saw no value in it.::Do you always just blindly accept the official historical narrative without ever questioning it, and tell people that dont agree that theyre wrong? If so, you might want to check out r/history. Theyll even remove comments that speak of alternative theories that the historical community doesnt approve of for you!Here at r/conspiracy though, we like to try and expand our minds by throwing out potential theories that dont always fit the currently accepted dogma. Rather than immediately try to prove that youre theory is right, why not take even a second to at least *entertain* the idea? Even just as a thought experiment. Another question: whats your opinion on the idea that there were once human civilizations equally, if not more advanced than our current civilization, that existed + years ago, whos recorded history has been lost to time, and only whispers of them exist today in mythology, religious texts, cave drawings, and carvings in places like Egypt?::If they were more advanced than our civilization, why were they behind us in terms of robotics and AI? Or at least, behind where we'll be in -50 years? Why wouldn't they leave smart robots to mine their gold instead, not susceptible to bacteria, predators, heat, cold, etc, and capable of working nonstop rather than needing to sleep eight hours a day and stop for food, drink, and emotional needs?If they didn't have the tech at the time (which even we will by ) why haven't they made those advances in the last tens of thousands of years and come back with robo super miners?::I'm reaching but maybe it could be used as energy.::Exactly. Im thinking it could have been used to throw energy wirelessly, like what Tesla was supposedly able to do.Have you ever seen the documentary The Giza Power Plant? Highly recommend checking it out if you havent.::&gt; used to throw energy wirelessly, like what Tesla was supposedly able to do.I mean... It's not like wireless energy isn't a thing already -[Cited from wikipedia:]()""In far-field or radiative techniques, also called power beaming, power is transferred by beams of electromagnetic radiation, like microwaves or laser beams. These techniques can transport energy longer distances but must be aimed at the receiver.""Not claiming this disproves anything, just sharing knowledge that yes, this does exist and is possible.::I just found out the great pyramid is actually sided and I've been researching this shit for years::You think theres a good capstone deep at the bottom too?::Not sure I understand the question sorry! I do know that the Giza plateau is a false bottom::Beneath the great pyramid at giza is a verticle shaft. The shaft has been filled in. It may interest you that there are also chambers beneath the sphynx.::Yes, under the paw guarding the hall of records, supposedly. The fact that they havent publicly explored it yet is absolutely insane.::You should check out youtube...the entrance is actually visible as maybe five bricks removed from the side of the sphynx to reveal a shaft. There's been a contemporary expanded steel grid set over the entrance and a ladder can be seen decending into the Giza plateau.::Yea its at the very rear if Im not mistaken. Theres also supposedly a hole on the very top of its head.Edit: [I made a post]() about this stuff not too long ago regarding the new Assassins Creed: Origins game. The fact that they referenced it I thought was cool af.::There is indeed a patch of concrete in the top of the sphynx's head. A very old photo shows a guy standing in a hole that used to be there.There's a ton of mystery surrounding the current construction taking place between and beneath the front paws of the sphynx. I'm glad the video game world is bringing some attention to this. The Egyptian government is keeping a very tight lid on its artifacts, but as this is a wonder of the world we're talking about I do not believe they have the right to do so.::Any chance the hole was weathering basin from all of Schoch/Hancock's rain?::The ""hole"" as you call it was not a result of weathering. You can clearly see that the Egyptian Govt. removed bricks to create the opening to the verticle shaft inside the sphynx.::Ahh, I just didn't know if you had seen ""inside"" it - do you have a source or anything on the picture of the man standing in?::I remember playing AC:2, where the dude who had gone insane in the Animus left notes on Templar activity throughout history that you could find. You had to do puzzles to unlock then after finding sigils hidden throughout the world. The level of depth was insane.One that blew my mind was an Easter egg. The puzzle was to scan through old (real) historical pictures looking through an x ray device for hidden magical objects that were secretly used. In one photo, I noticed a subtle binary code hidden in the corner ([see the discussion here]()) which translates to ""Ancient city, Rajasthan, India, irradiated by PoE"". And sure enough, there is an ancient ruined city there in real life that apparently is radioactive in a way that looks like an atomic bomb went off there thousands of years ago...::So they found something::Oh, they found something! If only the public was allowed to know its heritage, we might learn something about ourselves. As it is the artifacts were all probably removed never to be seen again.::&gt; You should check out youtubeMind providing a link so others don't have to dig forever?::Oh, sure...its something like ""chambers found under sphynx"" Edit: : skip to minutes in or so::Thank you very much.::I seem to remember reading at some point or another that the underground complex containing the hall of records was supposed to be so vast and comprised of rooms that looked identical to one another. Anyone who entered here would always find themselves back at the entrance. Maybe theyve tried but as yet still not found it?::WhaaaatIn a post full of interesting info, this was what broke me.::Submission statement:The energy properties of the Great Pyramid of Giza are discussed in this article. Appropriate as it relates to the sidebar story about Giza. What isn't acknowledged, because some Egyptologists are acting as gatekeepers, is that the Great Pyramid was not built as mausoleum for the Egyptian Pharoah Khufu (Cheops). It is much older than that, and like other ancient sites (Ollantaytambo, Easter Island etc) was inherited/appropriated by a later civilization which didn't have the same knowledge or such sophisticated technology to create these sites.::For those interested, the paper, published in the **Journal of Applied Physics**, can be seen here: PDF version of the paper can be seen here:::&gt; For those interested, the paper, published in the Journal of Applied Physics, can be seen here:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ; &gt; &gt; &gt; A PDF version of the paper can be seen here:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FIG. .

What do you know about Ollantaytambo? What's your evidence that the major architectural work wasn't Inca?What do you know about Ollantaytambo? Or about ""bollocks"" for that matter?OP did not say that NONE of the works at Ollantaytambo were created by the Inca. Some most certainly were, but the contrast between what the Inca are known to have built and the foundations on which they built are glaring.Example: if you can discern where ""the other builders"" left off, and where the Inca (et al) added to such structures.If you found a rascally kid drawing a mustache on the Mona Lisa with a Sharpie, would you ASSUME that the same kid must be the artist that originally painted the fucking Mona Lisa?(rhetorical question) ^::&gtee if you can discern where ""the other builders"" left off, and where the Inca (et al) added to such structures.The Inca built both. Fine, ashlar masonry takes a lot of work. It wasn't always feasible to use it for every structure (or even more than the foundation in some cases) in a complex. Also, Inca roofs were gigantic and hid much of the walls from view when present, marring our present interpretations of how the structures would look.::Look into graham Hancocks work::I have and it's absolute bollocks. He doesn't know what he's talking about. It's easy to make up stuff about truly ancient cultures, but the Inca were around only years ago. We know a ton about what they were up to and what they built.::You do realize the Inca themselves say they weren't responsible for many of the monolithic structures, right? And yet, it's otherwise thrown down our throats including the Inca's beliefs and knowledge of themselves is wrong. But I'm sorry... you were saying? lol::Yes, they werent responsible for the two millennia of civilization and architecture that preceded them in the Andes. They were however responsible for Ollantaytambo which is the topic being discussed.::Wrong again. Many MANY examples of very different building styles often side-by-side are shown in terms of differences in size of rock (pounds versus tons in terms of weight/size), cut (crudely placed and with clay/mud versus precision cut with no bonding agent), precision (jigsaw placed for earthquake prevention versus standard stacking of boulders) and even dating (lykan patches present with relative good integrity versus severe degradation from weathering and earthquakes). Two very unique styles of building and yet we are to think it's all from the same culture and period??Do you your own research and not what is taught for the masses of tourists who then think 'well, that is that'::Sure. There are cases where the Inca built on top of or beside older architecture. The Inca also used a variety of techniques and materials depending on the location and function of the structure. This has nothing to do with the claim that the Inca didnt build the impressive architecture at Ollantaytambo.::Think about what you just said. Why would the Inca deviate from a far superior method of building only to what seems to rebuild and imitate those structures? It's not as if you're going from Victorian mansion and replicating that on a smaller scale in suburbia. This variation in building style is so far beyond comparison from one another in terms of technological advancement and logistical planning, that we cannot even replicate some of the structures today. Let me repeat that - we cannot replicate some of the structures today. That's how advanced some of these things have been built and placed; the stuff the Inca's built right next to it or literally on top of is utter crap in comparison and it should be blatantly obvious.::&gt;Why would the Inca deviate from a far superior method of buildingBecause fancy stonework is expensive and time-consuming.&gt;in terms of technological advancement and logistical planning, that we cannot even replicate some of the structures todayYeah...bollocks. We can build sky-scrapers. I'm pretty sure we can cut up and stack some stones. &gt;Let me repeat that. We cannot replicate some of the structures todayThis is simply untrue. We may not know exactly how they built it, but that's a different claim entirely.::Now you're nitpicking.::&gt;He doesn't know what he's talking about.He's been researching this for years. He's been on the ground exploring and uncovering evidence since probably before you were even born. What have you done, mr anything that goes against my world view is ""bollocks""?::So, the length of his efforts are a testament to their validity? Appeal to effort falllacy we can call it. Why not actually defend the claim that the impressive architecture at Ollantaytambo wasnt built by the Inca? Youll find yourself short on credible sources on your side if you try.::No. His validity is in the evidence that he has published in his works. He's been a researcher for years and time and time again has been proven right about **his findings**. Look into the man and his works because clearly you have no idea what you're talking about.::&gt;time and time again has been proven right about his findingsAgain, bollocks. His central hypothesis about a global, technologically advanced civilization dating to BC has no good evidence to support it. He cherry-picks stray pieces of information from the work of actual scientists in order to sell his books to a credulous public who find anything about the ancient world more complicated than Atlantis too taxing for their attention.::From geological evidence of erosion on the Great Sphinx to . He's been proven right numerous times and more will come out. You can bet on that. The gatekeepers are losing their shit. Even the ""out of Africa"" theory is being debunked as we speak. I hope you and others truly have the mental fortitude for when it happens. Something tells me, you will fight tooth and nail defending Zahi Hawass until the end. Sad.::So one line of evidence related to water erosion vs. literally all of the historical and archaeological evidence suggesting that the Sphinx is part of Old Kingdom Egypt? This gets trotted out every time because this is literally ALL you have. Next you'll just write ""Gobekle Tepe"" or ""Comet Impacts"" as if these phrases suffice for evidence of Hancock's extraordinary claims. What are the predictions of his global civilization hypothesis? This isn't science; it's cherry-picking.Also, ""out of Africa"" is not being debunked. Just because anatomically modern humans interbred slightly with other species does not mean that modern humans did not originate in Africa.::Watch Graham Hancock's interviews on JRE. The guy's a Luciferian Gnostic.::I've been slowly coming to this conclusion too - the blue-beam might be more of a ""green beam"".... an ""awesome ancient civilization"" whose very discovery every human secretly hopes for - the [reappearance of the masters of wisdom since those first Atlantean days]()::Fascinating to see this being reported at such a mainstream source -- but...&gt; While the -foot pyramid built thousands of years ago for Pharaoh Khufu...Hah! No.::Also this:'The Ancient Egyptians that built the pyramids more than years ago were not aware of this quirk of design.'HOW ignorant can you be?!::It's a *quirk!*haha that's great..::Even when I was like , I remember thinking thats seems like an awful lot of work for a grave. The childrens story was that the pharaohs were so rich and so powerful they made everyone do this to remember them. Still dont buy that!::Look into the studies Russians have done about pyramids.

Just sayin'...::Good catch! Here is info on the 'Second Pyramid' or Pyramid of Khafre (mistakenly pictured in the article). It is somewhat smaller that the Great Pyramid.::I've actually been to it.My guide, an archeologist at the U of Cairo, pulled some strings to allow me to go in to the burial chamber and read the graffiti. He said it was because I was American and they will do anything we want to get the tourism dollars flowing again.But, it might have been a line and they let everyone go in. Can't be sure.::I would love to know more. Its on my bucket list but wont be getting ticked off for a while Id say::I went just after the revolution. Cairo was in a bit of disarray. Infrastructure was mostly shut down. There were no working taffic lights in the city. Roads were jammed, but everyone went with the flow. It was cool.Hired a personal guide for my wife and me. Surprisingly affordable. When we got off the plane, we got in a very long line for customs.Our hotel, Marriott, had sent a...greeter...to ease the process.He introduced himself, told us to follow him. Strode to an empty customs booth and slapped the counter hard. A customs person came over and told him (I assume) that the lane was closed. He gestured at us and said, ""Americans.""The clerk smiled big and immediately processed us. I felt funny about that. Not my style to jump line, but everyone, including the folks in line smiled warmly at us.Limo took us to the hotel. Guards we AKs waved at us.Got checked in. Hungry, went down to The Harry pub in the lobby. Pics of Dirty Harry, Potter, etc decorated the walls. Place was empty. One guy behind the bar.We ordered drinks. Asked for menus. Service was slow, but that was ok.As we were leaving we found out that the pub wasn't open and it was that fellows day off. But, he never mentioned it. Just gave us friendly service. Even had to make the run to a restaurant in the lobby to get our food. I felt awful. Tipped big.Our guide told most places that we went that we were Canadian. Said if he told them we were American they woukd have sent an armed guard with us everywhere.He said it was very safe, but when it comes to Americans they don't take chances.He drove us all over the country that week.The days lasted so long - he would take us everywhere and give detailed history about everything. Finally we would get tired and ask to go back to the hotel.Swelled with pride when he said that the beloved Anwar Sadat and American President Jimmy Carter were best friends. Even asked us to come to his home for dinner to meet his family.He had an apartment on the th floor with a perfect view of the pyramids.The feast he laid out defies description. Just so much food.Can't say enough good things about the place and the people. I wasn't accustomed to that kind of treatment. We did our best to be polite and respectful.::Not being rude but I wanted to know more about the Pyramid in general lol, but I did read your story and Ill give you credit where its due, that was a good read!::Haha...no problem...when you said it was on your bucket list, I thought you meant the trip itself.As far as the pyramids go, there is a lot if stuff that a good guide will tell you that you don't often read about....the thing about Belzoni the giant, how close it is to the city of Giza, that they used elephants to move the big stones, and such.They don't care for talk about aliens, slave labor...stuff like that. They present the history without any of the conspiracy/odd stuff.It was a very tight squeeze going into the pyramid to get to the burial chamber. I had to enter backwards - it was the only way I could get an angle of entry.It was so cramped that my wife lost her nerve and wouldn't go.::This is the stuff that really intrigues me. They don't care for talk about aliens and conspiracy stuff? That to me changes a lot. Aw man so many questions but cant word them!::elephants?that's the only time i've ever heard that::Me too. When I asked him how they moved the stones, he looked confused, like why was I asking such a simple question that was such common knowledge. He said, ""Elephants."", with a tone that seemed to suggest, ""How else would you move them?""::Why do you still call it a burial chamber if you admit there's no evidence pointing to that usage?::That is what the guide called it. So, that's what I call it.::Awesome travel story - thanks for sharing! I really want to visit someday.::I've been in Hurghada twice, two week trips both. I'm not a big tourist, did the usual shit and then decided to hook up with the locals. For one reason or another I befriended a local pharmacist one one trip, he was just the greatest guy. I'm from Europe, not the US, anyways... This guy invited me to his house to have dinner with him and his mates and it was such a good dinner, such good company, absolutely amazing.On another trip I made friends with this Russian dancer who was working in Hurghada for a few months I think, and he had some buddy whos family owned a pub which was closed for renovations, but it was beach-side, so he drove us there in the morning and we watched the sunrise on a completely empty and private beach, smoking a J - it was fucking beautiful. Some of my most memorable vacations definitely in Egypt. Lots of annoying shit too, that's why I mostly stayed with locals or in the hotel compound::Finally, a story from r/conspiracy that I actually believe...::Americans don't get special treatment anywhere when traveling the rd world. You guys are taken for a ride.::Maybe. I've been other places. Never got treated as well as I did in Egypt, though.::Thats great if its true.

rumoureval_345,Debunk this: Six Corporations Control % Of The Media In America,"That's pretty much true.::Sources at the end of it check out in both check out in being credible, and backing what the infograph is saying.::What is there to debunk?::It's not. See below.::Thanks for the update::Pretty sure that's true for most main stream media.::I mean I thought this was already a known thing, not much to debunk here::The real question is, what can you do about it?::Push to repeal the Telecommunications Act. Thanks a lot Bill Clinton.::I'm pretty sure it's down to now.::I can't believe people are missing the two obvious flaws in this analysis. This infographic doesn't show that companies control % of the media. It doesn't provide any basis for the % figure. That's just a number pulled out of the air. All it shows is that companies create and/or distribute a lot of media content. There are other problems, too. I will update this when I get a few minutes to expand on it. EDIT: Ok, let's explore why this graphic is partly true, partly false and partly misleading. This isn't a comprehensive examination, just a look at some problems that stood out to me.&gt; *Media has never been more consolidated. media giants now control a staggering % of what we read, watch or listen to.*The most fundamental problem is here. They give the numerator (the media giants and the media they create or distribute), but never give the denominator (the total amount of media Americans consume). In fact, the infographic seems to suggest that it is basically just comparing ownership of the largest media outlets in to ownership of those same outlets today....as if media consumption today is, apart from ownership, the same as it was in . *&gt; ""232 Media executives control the information diet of million Americans""*Where do these numbers come from? How does he arrive at media executives? What constitutes ""executive"" or ""control"" or an executive with control? The infographic does not explain. These are just numbers thrown out without any context or apparent methodology. The infographic says the Comcast/NBC merger guarantees ""monopoly of US markets like NYC and Chicago."" I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean. Comcast is not the only provider in NYC or Chicago, and NBCUniversal was not the only cable channel/content producer/network, so in what sense did the merger create a ""monopoly"" in markets? *&gt; ""In , the FCC forbade companies ownership of more than stations. Clear Channel Communications now owns over .""*In , Congress updated the Communications Act and eased ownership restrictions. As a result, some companies started buying a lot of radio stations. Many of those companies are now struggling to stay afloat, because radio audiences have cratered due to the rise of things like the iPod, satellite radio and the Internet. But, you argue, maybe radio would be doing better if it was still locally owned instead of owned by big chains. That's a valid hypothesis. Unfortunately, locally owned and operated radio stations are not doing particularly well, either. The entire industry is struggling. The ability to achieve economies of scale has helped many radio stations that would otherwise be even further underwater. This benefit, however, is balanced against the tremendous debt burden that ClearChannel and other big companies took on when buying up stations.In any event, ""80% of stations' playlists match"" because people are mostly the same everywhere. As exotic as those yankees/southerners/west coasters/midwesterners/people from Florida may seem to us, folks in other parts of the United States really aren't *all* that different. Well, maybe people from Florida are, but the rest of us are pretty similar. There are some differences, which is why some areas have more country/rap/alternative/jazz/classical stations than others, but people who like classic rock mostly like the same bands and songs. People who like top mostly like the same bands and songs. Radio stations do extensive audience testing to determine their playlists, to measure what songs are getting ""burned"" and what songs audiences like (or might like). There are some regional differences, but people mostly like the same things. People in radio often hear outsiders who are certain they know what the station should do differently -- more new music, more variety, whatever -- and, frankly, many radio people would prefer their stations had more variety and were more inventive. But you know what? They also realize that what people say they want and what people *actually listen to* are two pretty different things. If ""more new music/more variety"" worked consistently, radio stations would do that, because money. *&gt; ""The Big Six's box office sales hit $7 billion in , that's X the box office sales of the next Studios*""Wait, earlier the infographic were talking about how a few media giants ""control"" the media by owning everything. But this is a different claim. This claims that the few media giants are just *more successful* than ""the next studios"". If there are studios, then it sounds like there's a lot of competition to produce content and people just prefer the content produced by the ""Big ""....or, in reality, produced by one of many, many other studios and bought by the ""Big "" for distribution. And finally, the infographic closes with this dire warning: ""Until regulations return (or they buy each other out of existence), they will continue to control % of everything Americans see, hear and consider important.""Sounds serious, right? Now consider what some of the ""media consolidation"" Pollyanna's [were saying years ago](). &gt; ""The Internet has not yet evolved into a ubiquitous mass communications medium that can challenge the other media.""Yeah? How are those radio stations, newspapers and magazines holding up these days? &gt; ""The increasing concentration of the Internet is stunning. AOL's dominance of subscribership in the U.S. is widely noted ... Even more striking is the growth in the concentration of usage. Because the number of potential online channels is infinite, some assume that market dominance is an impossibility on the Internet. This is faulty reasoning. ... Analysis of Media Metrix data over the past three years shows an incontrovertible trend toward online media consolidation. Between March and March , the total number of companies controlling percent of user minutes online decreased by nearly two-thirds, from to four. Because AOL has such a dominant position (over percent of user time) the HHI is about , well above the moderately concentrated threshold. The four firm concentration ratio also falls in the range where concerns about concentration and the abuse of market power begin. Yes, years ago they were Deeply Concerned that a few companies, mainly AOL, would ""control"" online media. Shortly thereafter, AOL collapsed, Google and Facebook rose and every asshole with a Twitter account became their own media provider. There are big media companies. There always have been. We'll be fine. In the meantime, giving government more power over the media will not make things better.::RemindMe! hours::I will be messaging you on [**2016-04-14 :49:43 UTC**]( :49:43 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this link.**]()[**CLICK THIS LINK**]([]%0A%0ARemindMe! hours) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)]( Comment&amp;messageelete! d22hmx7)_____|[^([FAQs])]()|[^([Custom])]([LINK INSIDE SQUARE BRACKETS else default to FAQs]%0A%0ANOTE: Don't forget to add the time options after the command.%0A%0ARemindMe!)|[^([Your Reminders])]( Of Reminders&amp;message=MyReminders!)|[^([Feedback])]()|[^([Code])]()|-|-|-|-|-|::This was the debunkage I was looking for.

A station that doesn't serve it's market well may serve a different market simply by changing format. Competition and diversity are what make for a healthy market place.&gtivestiture isn't a solution to the problems the entire radio industry faces.That's wholly irrelevant to a discussion about consolidated media's detrimental effects on Democracy.Solutions to the radio industry's financial problems shouldn't come at the expense of a free press and a healthy Democracy.::&gt; That's speculation on your partIt is based on the fact that radio stations are struggling all over the country. There are obviously stations making a great deal of money, especially in large markets, but there are a lot of stations that are barely staying afloat whether they are locally or nationally owned. In fact, many locally owned stations had to sell to the national chains many years ago because they simply didn't have the resources to compete. &gt; Let the market decide what happens to each station individually. A station that doesn't serve it's market well may serve a different market simply by changing format. Yeah, that's how it works no matter who owns the radio stations. ClearChannel, Cumulus, Infinity...they will change the format in a heartbeat if they think the market will better support a different format. &gt; Solutions to the radio industry's financial problems shouldn't come at the expense of a free press and a healthy Democracy.I'm pretty skeptical that the identity of the owner of Hot is a critical element in maintaining our democracy. Whether it is owned by ClearChannel or by the local Smith family does not make *that* big a difference in the programming of the radio station. Both of them are trying to maximize profitability and that means adopting whatever research, experts and program directors tell them is most likely to succeed.::Shareholders control it too. They can start unloading shares which forces these corporations to make changes. Also what you watch matters.From what I remember though the media, especially print and TV news media, have had arrangements with their 'owners' about what the owners can and can't do. I am pretty sure they can't tell them how to report the news for example. There is a level of non-interference in the contracts when stuff was sold on and usually news group had people in them who continued to work there.Having said that, skeptics should be skeptical and I would agree with Noam Chomsky's documentary and book on the media - Manufacturing consent.",real
rumoureval_346,Debunk This: A friend of mine claims Red Dye causes ADHD and that it makes her hyper.,"From wikipedia: ""Though past research showed no correlation between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and food dyes,[15][16] new studies now point to synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents as aggravating ADD and ADHD symptoms, both in those affected by these disorders and in the general population.[17][18] Older studies were inconclusive, quite possibly due to inadequate clinical methods of measuring offending behavior. Parental reports were more accurate indicators of the presence of additives than clinical tests.[19] Several major studies show academic performance increased and disciplinary problems decreased in large non-ADD student populations when artificial ingredients, including artificial colors, were eliminated from school food programs.[20][21]""There is some scientific validity to what she is saying. Maybe she should be giving you the hard stare for automatically assuming she was wrong without doing your research first.::Hah, well I'll be damned. And to be fair, she's known for saying some really out-there things. But hey, being proven wrong on something is always a good experience. Thanks. I'll have to look into it more. What's the link for that, by the way? Would I just look up food dye on wiki?::Well, to be fair as well, it's Wikipedia.The FDA sponsored a review of the extant literature about two years ago. A summary of the findings here: : tlr whole article: No, food dyes conclusively do not *cause* ADHD. There is some possibility that it may exacerbate the symptoms a little. The increase is barely noticeable even in the subgroups (explains about % of the variation).::Red-head here. Food dyes are often used in shitty processed foods, which are also usually high in sugar. And other shit I'm allergic to, which can cause a wide variety of annoying symptoms, most of which result in fidgety behavior on my part. Feed me straight-out veggies for a week, and you'll find a much saner and more focused person in my skin. I know I don't speak for everyone, but I don't consider myself that unique either.::Sure. But now you're not talking really about *food dyes*, you're mostly talking about the difference between a shitty diet and a good one. If you stop eating foods with dyes in them, you've probably improved your diet markedly and that may have some impact, but not necessarily tied directly to the food dye itself. I'm pretty sure you could find a diet that contained not a single food dye that would result in the same symptoms.::Yeah, all allergies cause symptoms, not just allergies towards red dyes. I assume this also might be a factor in all those issues resolving the factuality of dye-effects, as mentioned in that first wiki-quote.::Yep. .::Thanks for that::No problem::My niece has an allergy to tartrazine, which is a chemical in red dye. One of the symptoms of her reaction is extreme irritability which could probably be confused for ADHD.

rumoureval_392,Cellphone radiation is real. Here are five ways to protect yourself.,", the only known affect of non-ionizing radiation is heating. It's not linked to cancer the way ionizing radiation is.Cellphones emit non-ionizing radiation only. In fact, the radiation emitted by a cellphone is generally between cm and cm. Whereas light needs to be at around nm to do damage, or around million times more energetic.They have to be this weak in order to be useful, only visible light and radio waves can punch through the atmosphere. For comparison, visible light ranges from -350nm, and we receive far more of it and radio waves from the sun than from our cellphones.::An initial problem with the article is the use of the blanket term 'radiation'. It's a nice scary word in a world terrified by nuclear weapons and power plant meltdowns, but it's a bit like saying 'food will make you fat!'. What kind of food? How much? How often? Does simply walking into your kitchen immediately turn you into a balloon? What about if you eat a few biscuits a day? A week?A number of different organisations have studied the potential dangers of cellphone emissions, and the results have been indecisive at best.As for the suggestions... well, they're functionally reasonable if one assumes that one's phone is in fact dangerously radioactive, but they render the phone barely usable. Might as well add:6) Submerge the phone in the center of a swimming pool. Water is very resistant to many forms of radiation, and this approach is used by all nuclear power plants to control radiation.::Ever heard of radiator? why was no one afraid of this, despite it being invented appx and the atomic age began in ?Radiators heated up our homes, but had no one railing against the dangerous gamma waves or beta particles coming out of it, despite it having RADIATION in the NAME. why?Because it is somehow understood with that, but not cell phones, microwaves, or tvs, that radiation is the act of giving off a form of energy. the way YOU RADIATE HEAT every day, or lightbulbs RADIATE light upon you. The light is given off and spreads throughout the room.

But it isn't dangerous.

There aren't any.::This. I'm not aware of any country that has these type of regulations.::[Canada has such a law]()::Good read, thanks!::Denmark has the [press ethical council]()The rules apply to all printed, radio and television media. Websites can, if they wish, join the ""club"" to gain the rights and be subject to the rules of the council. Rights include the option to protect sources, and the right to not testify in court. Anyone can complain about a story in the media, and the council will take it up.::There used to be regulations about news organisation being balanced, but they were removed in the s. The idea was that there was limited access to the broadcast spectrum and it was a privilege to be able to broadcast. But cable changed all that.::Probably refers to [this]().::Yeah, this was the closest thing I could find as well.::They do a lot of commentary on the news. Sean, bill, tucker are all commentators and don't do actual investigative reporting. That's my guess.::Those shows were all designed to mimic the op-ed sections of newspapers via a tv show.::As others have stated there are not any regulations that Fox is avoiding, but it does make a distinction between when it is showing News and when it is showing opinion shows. In the sense that Fox deflects complaints about lacking accuracy and truthfulness with the defense that O'Reilly, Hannity, etc. are doing an opinion program and not acting as news casters per se. This is to shirk accusations of dishonesty in media rather than avoid any actual regulations though.::Little late to the party but I think your coworker worded his argument incorrectly. Its smart on Fox News part to label their programs as entertainment as it does not have to take responsibility for the positions that its most popular hosts take. Even those programs still purport to be ""news"" they are clearly opinion based programs no different from talk radio and it is not their problem if their viewers don't look to see what programs are opinion based and whats news. Even on Fox News own term of use it states the information on its website is used for the viewers enjoyment and entertainment. And Ailes the former CEO had even stated in an interview that he did not view CNN and NBC as competitors but ESPN and TNT. Doesnt prove anything but interesting to compare yourself to entertainment networks and still claim to be a news network. Now your co worker is wrong to say fox news is classified as entertainment as they do actually have a news program, (although them sharing one side of the story is a whole different debate) however their most popular programs like bill o'riley and sean hannity are where the majority of their views and ""news come from. In that case then the news most of thier views are getting can be classified as entertainment and can be extreamly misleading.::I had erroneously assumed that on Debunk This people would use sources.::""regulations regarding factual reporting"" There is no such thing.::Not in the US, but as u/Wolfsburg mentioned, [Canada]() has such a law.::He's likely referring to when News Corp split into a 'media and entertainment' division and a publishing division in .

rumoureval_409,Is it true that some people in America gets jailed for life to stealing witout violence? Why?,"For example, California has whats known as a three-strikes law. If you get convicted for three felonies it doesnt matter what they are, you go to jail for life. You heard that right, we decided that people should spend their lives in prison for stealing candy bars because we thought it made a cool baseball analogy.::Fuck California.They fuck up their own state, then move to other states and proceed to fuck them up.::So it is after the third strike and not on the first? Thats not too bad i guess.::That's an exaggeration. The three-strikes law only applies to persons convicted of violent crimes or serious felonies. You can be arrested for the same misdemeanor as often as you want, that law won't apply to you. That law actually makes sense, because why would you want violent criminals and serious felons running around free? Especially after they had two previous chances to correct their lives and get their shit together.::Plenty of states have three-strikes laws that do not just apply to violent crimes or serious felonies. Many of these folks should be locked away. But the fact that there are relatively harmless folks who have been deprived of a normal life and a chance to be a regular citizen is no exaggeration.[ACLU report on non-violent offenders sentenced to life without parole in the US.]() Some of those crimes included things like:* attempting to cash a stolen check * a junk-dealers possession of stolen junk metal (10 valves and one elbow pipe)* possession of stolen wrenches * siphoning gasoline from a truck * stealing tools from a tool shed and a welding machine from a yard * shoplifting three belts from a department store * shoplifting several digital cameras * shoplifting two jerseys from an athletic store * taking a television, circular saw, and a power converter from a vacant house * breaking into a closed liquor store in the middle of the night::Sounds like some people should have learned their lesson the first two times instead of committing the exact same crime over and over again. I have no sympathy for criminals. They had a choice to obey the law and not go to jail, or break the law and go to jail, and they chose the latter.::You're heartless. Most of these people were poor and in bad situations - something coming out of prison is pretty much guaranteed to do to you. And even then, you'll put someone behind bars *for their entire life* for stealing three belts? What an asshole.::I've been poor and in bad situations, yet I've never committed a crime. These people aren't being placed behind bars for their entire lives for committing one crime, they're being placed behind bars for their entire lives because they would have otherwise spent their entire lives committing crimes. You'd think coming out of prison, you'd turn your game around in order to, oh I don't know, avoid going to prison again. If you keep doing the same old shit, you'll get the same old punishment.::Have you been homeless? Did you have schizophrenia? Do you have no family members who are capable of financially taking care of you if you suddenly lose your job and have difficulty finding a new one immediately?There are people with worse luck than you, I guarantee it. And still, even if you don't buy any of this, like I said: thinking someone should spend the rest of their life in prison for stealing belts makes you an asshole. It just does. That's not an appropriate punishment.&gt; If you keep doing the same old shit, you'll get the same old punishment.Life in prison, by definition, can only be a punishment you receive once.::Being homeless or schizophrenic doesn't give you any reason or excuse to break the law. The law is in place no matter what your situation is. Follow the law, and stay out of prison. Break the law, and go to prison. It's a choice. Some people just made the wrong choice.If somebody lands themselves in prison for life for continuously stealing, that was their choice. It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested. &gt;Life in prison, by definition, can only be a punishment you receive once.Not if you're getting life in prison for committing the exact same crime three times. Life in prison for repeat offenders makes sense. Your sentence increases every time you repeat an offense, so eventually, your sentence will expire after you expire. There's a way to avoid that, however. If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again.::Being homeless doesn't give you a reason to break the law? What? How do you eat when you don't have a job? Panhandling is illegal, people won't give you work...it makes sense that people resort to theft. Doesn't make it right, but a man's gotta eat.I would also disagree with you that some schizophrenics are making a choice to break the law. Some of these people have lost touch with reality.&gt; If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again. That's a really nice thought. Too bad that if you're in prison for life, there's zero chance of that happening. Look, I get the whole ""you keep doing this, we're going to make it worse on you until you stop."" But there's a whoooole lot of room between a year in prison for minor theft and the rest of your life. Sentence someone to five years, ten years. Hell, sentence them to thirty years and that's probably *still* less than life in prison. Thirty years! For stealing three belts! Who's heartless enough to do that to a person? After thirty years your old life would be unrecognizable. It doesn't make sense to punish someone that long because they're not even the same person they were when they committed the crime. Life in prison is *worse* than that.&gt; It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested. It does matter that you agree with that decision, because these laws won't change until most people change their minds about stuff like this. And until then, these people will be *bigger* drains on society because, like we both agreed on, it's not worth $30,000 dollars a year to house and feed someone just because they stole $15 worth of stuff.::&gt;How do you eat when you don't have a job? Go to a homeless shelter, or a church, or a charity. They're always dishing out food to the homeless. &gt;Too bad that if you're in prison for life, there's zero chance of that happening. But in this instance, you're only in prison in life on the third offense. The offender had two other chances to fix what he did wrong, but he chose to make the same mistakes again. &gt;it's not worth $30,000 dollars a year to house and feed someone just because they stole $15 worth of stuff.I agree, but it's also not worth it to have these people free to continue to commit the same crimes over and over again. Edit: For the record, I agree about your point on schizophrenics. In those instances, mental health evaluations would do a lot more good than a prison sentence.::Btw, the government pays $30-60,000 a year to keep those vicious belt thieves off the streets. That's your taxes and mine.::That's the part I don't agree with. $30,000 is a bit much to be spending on a prisoner. I've never even made $30,000 in a year, so it's absolutely ridiculous that the costs of housing one prisoner is that steep. They're not worth that much. They contribute nothing to society.::No, that isn't a normal thing.::It can. There is regular theft that is a misdemeanor if it's under $1,000. Higher than that is grand larceny. Then there is robbery which falls into several categories.As to your question though, there are white-collar crimes like embezzlement, fraud, bribery, racketeering, Ponzi schemes, etc. Depending on the seriousness, the judge, and a myriad of other factors, someone can get life sentences or longer for these kinds of crimes. Some countries punish white-collar crime with death sentences as well.::I actually read that there is this guy who stole a jacket worth like $165 and another who stole gasoline and both of them got life imprisonment.::Both true!",real

rumoureval_415,[serious] Man and dinosaurs lived at the same time.,"Well, the article you've linked is fairly... well content free. For the most part it is just blanket assertions, without even bothering with the normal cherry picking, misquotes and misrepresentations of studies, or studies done badly that can be debunked. But this is answers in genisis, they have far more on their page and a really a good portion of ken ham's work, is plagerized from convicted tax fraud kent hovind, of whom you can find an incredible series by thunderf00t on youtube ""why do people laugh at creationists"" if you want a more direct with ken ham's involvement Bill Nye had a very entertaining debate with Ken ham for this article in particular::Please don't give Thunderf00t any views.::Devil's advocate here: why? I've watched some of his videos. The style is slightly irritating and some points are poorly made, but nothing that I'd tell people to not watch because of.::I'd say more likely, his videos on topics that are outside of the hard sciences, he is pretty bad/obnoxious. Namely his videos against feminism and the few that he actually goes at the bible, on it's own merits, as well as the videos he attempts to interview/debate. He tends to do far worse at proving his points, say things in ways that provoke more than educate. Even when I agree with his concept, his style and terrible points, make me wish I didn't.IMO thunderf00t is still one of the best at attacking psudo-science, with actual science, but he often comes into topics he doesn't know as well, with the same confidence as he has in the subjects he is actually good at. IMO I reccomend his why people laugh at creationists series, but would not recommend the majority of other videos on his channel.::I haven't seen his videos on feminism, but yeah you summed it up pretty well. You've convinced me.::&gt;This would mean, of course, that there would have been millions of creatures during that time that would be in between, as amphibians evolved into reptiles. Evidence of these transitional forms, as they are called, should be abundant. Firstly, no scientist expects fossil evidence to be ""abundant."" [Fossilisation]() is something which happens extremely rarely. An organism has to die in quite specific circumstances in order to end up as a fossil, and the vast majority of plants and animals will just decay into nothing. It's only because of the sheer age of the world and the number of organisms that have lived and died that we are able to find so many fossils. But the fossil record is by it's nature incomplete. Secondly, there are plenty of examples of transitional fossils. However, these are also examples of unique species. Any organism discovered which is sufficiently different from other known organisms gets classified as a new species. If we know about Species A and Species C, and we believe Species C to be a descendant of Species A, then we might look for a species which is an ancestor of Species C *and* a descendant of Species A, which we'll call Species B. B would be a ""transitional form"" between A and C. However, the standard response of creationists is then to ask ""Where's the transitional form between A and B?"" Futurama summarised this ""debate"" process [rather well]()::The others have given good answers, and I would like to add to the mix.But over and above that, a little rational thought might be an interesting place to work from. Consider the following train of thought:1) There are a hell of a lot of people involved in the sciences. Everything from medical research to physics to geology to orbital mechanics to engineering and materials, etc.2) A subset of these people are involved in Paleontology, but relevantly their work _overlaps_ with these other sciences. Radiometric dating overlaps with nuclear physics. Strata dating overlaps with geology. Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology.3) All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we _use_ them. We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings. We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications, from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming. We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades, and satellites serving our communications, and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies. We have cellphones.4) All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species. It's all the same mechanics, just a slightly different application. To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know _anything_ about driving a hatchback.So, this leads us to one of three conclusions. Either...a) We're somehow wrong about how everything works, and all the stuff we've managed to do is sheer luck that it works, despite our misunderstanding.b) It's all a giant 'evolutionist' conspiracy, one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population (at least, the population with power and influence). The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear, since I can't see a real reward.c) The bible literalists are wrong.Personally, I'm leaning towards 'c' as the most likely answer.::&gt;However, scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages. They only uncover dead dinosaurs (i.e., their bones), and their bones do not have labels attached telling how old they are. The idea of millions of years of evolution is just the evolutionists story about the past. No scientist was there to see the dinosaurs live through this supposed dinosaur age. In fact, there is no proof whatsoever that the world and its fossil layers are millions of years oldThis is simply not true. The main way scientists can date fossils they find is by referring to the [geological strata]() in which the fossils were found. The only working explanation for the existence of strata is that they were laid down over millions of years (before Darwin, it was actually geologists who first questioned the age of the Earth and the biblical creation myth.) By looking at which stratum a fossil was found in, you can get an idea, to the nearest million years or so, when the fossil was formed.You can also use radioactive decay to date certain types of rock found in the same stratum. Carbon dating isn't much good for dinosaur fossils, as it can only date objects younger than about years, but by looking at the decay of elements with longer half-lives like uranium, you can determine when certain (volcanic) strata were laid down. If you find a fossil above a stratum you know is million years old, and below a stratum you know is million years old, that fossil must be between and million years old.::Look up AronRa on youtube, watch his ""foundational falsehoods of creationism"" series. It eats AiG alive.::Ugh, I was going to go through the article but it's such a load of crap I honestly don't have the energy.I'm just going to leave it at all dinosaurs (excluding birds) died out roughly million years ago. Humans only date back to around thousand years ago.

May want to check for typos in future buddy::Wow... I definitely shouldn't reddit immediately after waking up. Thanks and sorry for any brain damage reading that may have caused.::And we jacked up their agricultural infrastructure a bit, I am pretty sure.::Not every person entering the US at the southern border is from Mexico. There are plenty of people fleeing the chaos and violence decades of US military intervention have created in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and other countries in Central America.::MS-13 was also created in the US, and deporting gang members back is how it gained a foothold in Central America. They have also been extremely active in Mexico.The gang also possible traces roots back to the Salvadoran civil war, which was exacerbated by the US pumping military aid to the Salvadoran government. The Salvadoran government has been found to have been responsible for most of the civilian casualties.So, one of the largest, most active gangs is actually a by-product of US-government led actions.::Oh lord. Shut up.::Which everyone like yourself has no problem coming to terms with once they're decades past, but while they're ongoing you buy right into the propaganda like a good like brainless sheep.::The most recent Latin American leader deposed by the US was Noriega, not exactly a social democrat, in Panama in years after we dropped nuclear bombs on Japan, the Japanese were selling us Datsuns and Sonys.20 years after we firebombed Germany, West Germany was importing guest workers. When are the democracies in Latin America going to get their acts together? What incentive do they have to do so?::The US rebuilt Germany and maintained a huge military presence in Japan for decades. What you're describing was in the context of war. It's no surprise that operations with the goal of long term destabilization end up destabilizing things in the long term if nothing is done to fix it.::We were shoving our hands into Latin America and making problems long before we did anything to Noriega. Japan and Germany weren't next door to us with obscenely profitable drug trades that encourage violence. America, with all its resources, can't even mop up gang activities in its own backyard, and we expect smaller, less-equipped countries to deal with even larger and more violent criminal threats *bankrolled by us*? C'mon.::Costa Rica is a pretty nice place to live. Except for that island off the coast with the runaway dinosaurs. /sPanama has improved so much that it is giving the Cayman Islands a run for hiding rich people's money from progressive governments.It's not impossible for competent governments to function in the region. People just have to make imprisoning criminals a priority over imprisoning women who have miscarriages.::I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure Costa Rica is only stable because they don't _have_ a military that the US could have used to stage a coup. Like they literally abolished their military during the Cold War, I think specifically because of US ""intervention"" in Latin America.::Republican defense contractors can't make money selling to Costa Rica. You have to wonder how the Ticos have managed to pull that off. And why other countries can't.::I checked, and it looks like they just abolished the military to prevent another civil war after theirs ended right before the end of WWII. So, they managed it by abolishing the military before the US _really_ started to get out of hand down there. I'll be surprised if any others can follow suit, though Haiti did abolish theirs recently as well.::Panama is used as a major drug trafficking *port* and gets a hands-off on the worst of the violence, whereas Mexico is so large and populated that its status as a border country doesn't matter because that's where so many of the producers and their rich overlords are living. Panama is used as the clean business front. You also can't ignore the *positive* involvement of the US in Panama (overseeing the canal); we have an obvious economic interest in Panama *not* being a terrifying place because it would shit all over our trade, whereas the security of Mexico or Colombia is less of a concern for us. First, the way we profited by drug countries was *through* the creation and sale of drugs. Then, when those drugs are sold in the US, we profit by criminalizing them and filling the prisons with cheap labor, with the secondary ""benefit"" of disproportionately targetting people of color and other undesirables; a fine bonus for the racists in charge of policy. Fear of violence increases the production and sale of arms, both small (for the protection of the average citizen) and military-grade (in case we need another intervention). We can also sell weapons to those countries now facing the drug violence we basically bankrolled, leading to more profit. That fear also drives citizens here to vote for the political party viewed as ""tougher"" on crime, which does not create any incentive for said party to *actually* help solve the problem so long as they can keep up appearances alone. The ways by which we profit from instability in Latin America are viewed as more favorable or personally enriching by certain people in power (not just politically, but economically) than the ways we might profit if those countries were safe and our own citizens weren't addicts.::If America causes these places to be how they are, then why isn't Canada some drug\-exporting dump like the rest of them?I've been there, the place in life where we need to put the US at the center of everything. Every problem everywhere is our fault. You'll get over it. Some places are just not that great.::Thats about when we changed from regime change to economic control via the World Bank, huge corporations, and so on.::Japan and Germany were both rich, powerful, industrialized countries with huge economies before WWII. The war destroyed them, and while they were down time America reigned supreme. Then they recovered, and sold us Toyotas and Volkswagens. It's absurdly ignorant to expect small, impoverished countries in Central America to magically reach the same level of power. Their economies are based on things like farming. And Americans really have screwed them over. If you don't believe me, read up on what we did in El Salvador in the s.::^ yup::Well Trump and his ilk point out that crossing the border without papers is criminal and therefore every undocumented person is a law breaker.Ignoring of course the + years of immigrants coming from Europe without papers and the Chinese who help build the railroads here.The fact is that if you are here without papers, it is of necessity means staying away from the police by obeying every law they can. So one groups says they commit fewer crimes and the other groups says they're all criminals and they're both right in their own way. Economically they are a vital part of our work force and to kick them all out would not only cost a lot of money to get them out, but much of our food crops would rot in the fields.So we need to figure out some compromise for everyone's sake.::Not only that, you think they're not exploited by people this whole time? Taken advantage of and with nowhere to turn?::Yep. As immigration enforcement increases fewer crimes are reported:&gt;""...Hispanics reporting sexual assault have dropped nearly percent in the first three months of this year, compared to last year. And the number of Hispanic\-reported robberies and aggravated assaults are each down percent.""\([article]() refers to Houston, TX\) Immigrants and Native born Latinos in general are less likely to report crime:&gt;""A recent survey of advocates and attorneys from states and the District of Columbia indicated that percent of sexual and domestic violence survivors who are immigrants expressed concerns about contacting the police."" &gt; &gt; percent of Latinos surveyed reported they are less likely to contact police officers if they have been the victim of a crime because they fear that police officers will use this interaction as an opportunity to inquire into their immigration status or that of people they know. &gt; &gt; percent of Latinos stated that they are less likely to voluntarily offer information about crimes, and percent are less likely to report a crime because they are afraid the police will ask them or people they know about their immigration status. &gt; &gt; percent of undocumented immigrants reported they are less likely to contact law enforcement authorities if they were victims of a crime.""[article ]() and [research cited]()edit: insert hyperlinks::This is a huge problem and will also be a tragically twisted propaganda point for immigration hawks who will pretend it means crime is dropping as immigration enforcement increases. As they crack down on drugs and eliminate social services, I'm worried we'll see the same thing among citizens, since cops routinely haven't been held accountable for high profile interrace killings.::To reduce exploitation, legal pathways should be made easier. We spent thousands on my wife's immigration attorney and federal fees and it was a very stressful and grueling process. If it's true that we require foreign laborers, then we should make it easier for them to follow the law. This benefits all parties.::Unfortunately, there are many less reasonable and compromising. They push anti-immigration as a means to promote their underlying racist agendas.A few years back I wouldn't have even considered this to be true but the public alt-right has shown me otherwise.::Be careful with what you read. It's nearly impossible to know the truth about any issue that has been politicized. I refuse to believe hate is common in the hearts of my fellow citizens.::Oh boy, have you been on the internet lately? Its like the KKK in everybody suddenly decided to wake up and a)through the veil of anonymity and b) being emboldened by a white supremacist president people are not afraid to unleash their racist ideologies. Seriously, people arent afraid to be openly racist now. ( I put openly in quotes because its the internet.) People are full of hate and theyre blaming their problems on underrepresented minorities and undocumented workers.::Also, illegal residency/immigration is a _civil_ offense, not a criminal one.::Funny how they still get put in prison for this ""civil"" offense.::Well, yeah, but that's how the US seems to deal with any problems involving poor people and/or minorities. Regardless, it is technically a civil infraction.::&gt; So one groups says they commit fewer crimes and the other groups says they're all criminals and they're both right in their own way.Anti-immigration folks love to point out how many illegals are in prison, but they fail to mention that they're in prison for immigration violations. Duh.&gt; Economically they are a vital part of our work force and to kick them all out would not only cost a lot of money to get them out, but much of our food crops would rot in the fields.110% this. It's already happened in states that threatened to get tough on illegals. We simply don't have enough citizens looking for work. Thanks Obama!::They boarded up the doorway and have people with guns watching the door and they are asking why people aren't using the door.::Im not down with slave labor, they need to go back to Mexico and apply the legal way.::But... THE NARRATIVE!::&gt;face facts...You're talking to Republicans?!?-Facing facts is not something they do.::of course they do. They arent fucking here to commit crimes they are here to lead a better life and dont take for granted the opportunities that they have and make the most of it why would they squander that for a life of crime.::Fun fact No SHit::There's really no point in arguing that immigrants commit fewer crimes because that is not the standard being applied. The only acceptable number of immigrant crimes for conservatives is zero. An impossible standard but then that's the point. Someone once put it to me in relation to Syrian refugees as 'if there was a jar with jelly beans and you told me one was poisoned I wouldn't eat from the jar'.I responded by saying: let's change the analogy so that jelly beans are people and say that one is 'poison' and of the other , a certain number will suffer and/or die if they're not let in. Then he started with how they're economic migrants and not in any danger so I gave up::It's ironic. This argument is the one made by radical feminists and their distrust of men with regards to rape.::Really? Ive never seen feminists use that argument, ever. I would know, I am one.::Never heard of the poisonous M&amp;M analogy? If you have a bowl of M&amp;Ms, and one is poisonous, you have to treat them all like they're poisonous. Same thing with men and rapists.I stated rad fems, not your run-of-the-mill moderate, so that may be why. I've seen it used as a justification for treating % of the population with a deep seated mistrust and animosity.::I had an entire response typed out, but I just cant even start this debate today. Please see why is stupid as fuck. Should be easy.::...Really?OK: thought experiment:&gt;Not all Immigrants.&gt;Its the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. Its never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech ! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.&gt;Heres how it usually goes:&gt;Local: Ive been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think its important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldnt. Isnt it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?&gt;Well, actually&gt; The brigade dont sincerely think that locals talking about the violence weve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why immigrants continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldnt be controversial.&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and youve reminded us enough, thanks.&gt; So doesnt clarify anything. It doesnt add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that not all immigrants are like that, are actually saying is, Im not like that. Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and theyd like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on . To ask us to hand out cookies and Well Done For Not Raping Anybody badges to immigrants who rush to tell us , is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.&gt; If you are an immigrant and dont recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldnt offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying locals voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.My very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. And as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the ""oh, but we don't **really** mean all men.""Change the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. Some men.A minority of men.A sub-population of men.Certain kinds of men.Whatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men.But not all men. You're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. And on a side-note: the ""lived experiences"" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about ""lived experiences"", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias.Alt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived experiences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs.Lived experiences are never a good argument when formulating policy.I won't throw out lived experiences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done. This is exactly what I was referring to. The exact same logic is used by certain feminists to justify rhetorically putting all men in the same basket. And we not only don't deserve it, I, personally, will defend my character and identity, which is under attack when AllMen is used.::So basically more immigrants = safer america.Makes you wonder why trump wants to ban all immigration and build the wall.::Because it's red meat to his base.::I don't like articles/opinions that don't source anything...

Yet despite offending less, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re-arrested in the three-years following their initial contact with the justice system. Divergence in the pattern of results contingent upon the measure of criminal behavior self-report or official arrest warrants focused consideration to disentangle whether the difference is due to: systematic crime reporting bias (e.g., under-reporting of crime among undocumented immigrants), differential treatment in the criminal justice system (e.g., intensified policing), or a combination of factors.Last of all, there are much better articles which source their claims.[Washington Post]() has a pretty good article.::I really appreciate you posting this because I came into the comments specifically because I was dubious of the claims presented, despite that they validate my pro-immigrant bias.

See all Questionable sources.Bias: Extreme Right, Hate GroupNotes: The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is a non-profit research organization that favors far lower immigration numbers and produces research to further those views. It was started as a spin-off from John Tantons Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) in . Reports published by the CIS have been widely deemed misleading and riddled with basic errors by scholars on immigration; think tanks from across the ideological and political spectrum; media of all stripes; several leading nonpartisan immigration-research organizations; and by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The organization has also drawn criticism for its financial and intellectual ties to extremist racists. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published reports in and connecting CIS to John Tanton, who helped found various other organizations, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and NumbersUSA, and showing he has ties to white supremacy groups and a eugenics foundation (SPLC). Bottom line, this is a hate group. (2/8/2017) from an outside perspective (UK)The SPLC has done it's due dilligence in this matter, from the politifact link alone I would agree with their sentiment.Your problem is that you are ignoring the fact that conservwtive viewsAre being espoused by the alt-right and neo-nazi/KKK crowd, after all david duke endorsed trump, the alt-right and tge neo-nazis and the KKK follow a conservative ideology and believe that conservative policy will bring about their version of the U.S (the 's social mess, pre suffrage or civil rights movement or a white ethnostate, with P.O.C and minorites expelled or enslaved).If you don't want them coopting your platform, chsnge your platform how hard is it to not want to treat women, P.O.C and minorities like shit? You have neo-nazis running for office in the conservative party (GOP, illinois, california, minnesota/michigan).

I disagree with your assessment on sam harris (borderline religious lunatic was my first impression), pinker keeps railing on about 'enlighenment' and comes across as Pompous twat with his head up his own arse, he may be a psychologist and a harvard graduate but he rants about nothing like a motherfucker. (the term itself is a giant red flag, a conservative 'buzzword' used soley as a broad brush) would say that while he espouses some more left-leaning points, harris is more at home in the pseudo-intallectual crowd, he talks a big game and falls short, but people just insist he is 'genuine'.Yet here you are trying to paint them as a monolith of 'the left', typical american conservative, no facts only fiction.::Lets forget for a second that this is a trash article from an unheard of publication with zero sources.If you are a parent, and your child misbehaves, you discipline your child and try to make him a better person.

Well, does anyone else have a question here? Do the police report on immigration status for all crimes? What about crimes where the perpetrator is not apprehended or identified? Are we talking about all immigrants or combining legal and illegal ones or just illegal immigrants? ""Undocumented immigrants reported lower offending both before they entered the study and then in the following three years after their first arrest,"" - sure.::&gt;The researchers looked at the boys in the categories of legal immigrants, unauthorized immigrants and U.S. born offenders. Just as in past studies, this one found that immigrants as a whole commit less crime than native-born Americans.::&gt; self-reported by illegal immigrants Self-reported in any survey of behavior is not verifiable. And considering the question is about crime I would not expect the facts to be represented accurately by the subjects. I wonder who would seriously believe this to be meaningful reporting.::Where are you getting that their status was self reported in these studies?::From the article:&gt; *undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three years following first arrest.* referring to a study who's author Alex Piquero, one of the authors of the paper and a criminologist, is quoted in saying:&gt;""Undocumented immigrants reported lower offending both before they entered the study and then in the following three years after their first arrest,""::Lol. Seems you can not read/understand English. This's so funny I can't stop laughing like for real. What an irony.::That's because you've been tricked by the author and researcher, not me.

The requirements for several of the working visa programs have changed significantly, and the ban-that-isn't-about-Muslims-but-totally-is-about-Muslims makes people not want to come here for fear of getting turned away at last minute. Many people with green cards and visas were caught up in the travel ban. There was a reason that several states sued to overturn the ban, and it's not because they love illegal immigrants.EDIT: They also talk about ending chain migration, which is what allowed people like Trump and Pence to be in this country in the first place. They got theirs and now they want to make sure no one else has a chance.::California loves illegal immigrants and we sued. California is going to loose several representatives in Congress if the feds decide to count non citizens.::This isnt even debatable: it easier or harder to immigrate legally has nothing to do with how someone feels about illegals, it has to do wh the economic impact that comes with adding to a population.

They claim % of Money Laundering/Racketeering convictions were for non-citizens, but the USSC data shows % for Money Laundering and % for Racketeering (separate categories) and I can't see how they get % from that. Their numbers for sex offenses and homicides don't match up either. The numbers for auto theft are double what USSC has listed. Find a better, less biased source that isn't associated with white nationalists.&gt; Making it easier or harder to immigrate legally has nothing to do with how someone feels about illegals, it has to do wh the economic impact that comes with adding to a population.The right uses their supposed hatred of illegals as an cover for their general xenophobia.

Piquero who is mentioned in OP's link.::I read them. Your first quote describes the feelings and opinions that first generation youth have toward the legal system \(it states nothing about actual crime rate\). Your second quote is taken from the 'Objective' section of the research article \(which serves to provide context for the current research being performed\), here the author is stating a claim, in this case he is citing his own research in the study, this is not the conclusion statement of the research article. All these studies were of youth who had already committed a crime, so more of a study in recidivism, not crime rate across whole populations. [Here]() is the actual, full Migration Letters study that is cited in the news article. From p. Discussion \(my commentary in brackets\): First, consistent with previous research, self\-reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system \(i.e., first arrest\) is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US\-born peers. \[immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops \(fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made\); see my previous posts in another parent thread\] Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three\-years following first arrest. \[undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self\-reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation\] Third, and in contrast to the findings for self\-reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re\-arrested and are re\-arrested more in the three\-years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re\-arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. \[hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self\-reported evidence isn't so robust?\]::Nothing about ""feelings and opinions"" in the ABSTRACT. Not sure why you keep hammering that.You are implying these supposed thoughts and feelings. In fact, i'm not quite sure why asking undocumented immigrants if they've been arrested counts as ""thoughts and feelings"", and why it is *bad* to ask undocumented immigrants about their past.To reiterate, the premise of your argument, ie ""this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings"", in reality, are researchers asking specific questions about their experiences with criminal behavior etc.That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested, you know, by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior.Not only do they ask fact\-based questions, researchers also do what is called ""cross referencing"", in that they look up judicial records to VERIFY what they've been told.In the link you posted, this is an excerpt from the ABSTRACT: &gt;""Results suggest that, as compared to documented immigrants and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest""Another excerpt from the CONCLUSION: &gt;""Justification for heightened immigration enforcement and the criminalization of immigration law is based on the assertion that undocumented immigrants represent a distinctly dangerous class. With this research, we **add to the limited knowledge base** and **investigate crime** among those lacking legal US residency **by assessing patterns of offending longitudinally, both prior to and following first arrest, using self\-reported offending and officially recorded arrest measures.**""So what exactly is wrong with their methodology again?There is NO OTHER WAY to determine if someone UNDOCUMENTED has been arrested without first asking.::So are the crimes that are committed by them that are used to say they commit more crimes.::This isn't about immigrants, it's about ILLEGAL immigrants, the ones that are currently breaking the law at any given moment, get it right.::Good thing we're debating illegal immigration so this is all irrelevant::Umm, actually, illegals are criminals as soon as they hop the border and they continue to be so as they work illegally under the table or use stolen identities to work above it. The fact that they keep their heads down trying to avoid getting caught and so minimize their involvement in other types crimes has nothing to do with it.::What about ILLEGAL immigrants?::illegal or not, they are all still immigrants.illegal simply means they dont have papers but the point stands as most immigrants, like those from central/southern mexico, are less likely to commit crimes than their nd gen and rd gen counterparts.I would go on to say they are trying to escape violence and hardship and understand what it is like when their government fails to implement the rule of law. But thats my take on it.::Okay, cool... still not a free pass to illegally enter the country and live here::""Illegal""::I've said it once and I'll say it again, the blacks NEVER UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should have been ""quarantined"" by Trump in Washington state, really surprised this isn't bigger news.::link?::Face facts: free flow immigration is a detriment to western society::Is there no middle ground?

Thats not how it is today, and thats not what literally any Democratic politician wants. Here is Keith Ellison wearing a T-shirt that says I dont believe in borders in Spanish. Ellison is not just a democrat, he is the Deputy Chair of the DNC.::But how does that translate into actual policy? Is there anyone who has actually supported open borders?Its not a tenable position. And youre creating a straw-man arguing that open borders is part of the Democratic platform.Reforming immigration, which is what the left wants, to adjust to reality is better than the fear mongering of the right.::How did I create a strawman? I showed you a prominent member of the DNC who says he doesnt believe in borders.To you, what does it mean when someone says they dont believe in borders?::Youre creating a straw man by insinuating the Democrats advocate open-borders in policy. You refuse to address that because you know your insinuation is false. Or maybe its willful ignorance. Regardless, youre wrong.And dont red-hats hate when people misconstrue dumb things they do or say? Like, when Trump retweeted those far-right anti-Islam videos, red-hats argued that they didnt really reflect some policy belief for Trump.And now youre arguing the opposite.Ill edit in what I think the shirt means.::I dont see an edit.Also, not sure who youre quoting when you quote open borders. I never said the words open borders. You did. I wasnt the one creating the strawman. You are.All I did was point out that a Democratic Party leader is wearing a shirt that says in Spanish that he doesnt believe in borders. It is a fact, not an argument.Im genuinely curious what you think I dont believe in borders written in Spanish means.But youve been disingenuous thus far. Im not holding my breath for an honest discussion.::Legal immigration is the only recourse. There shouldn't be a fast pass to citizenship. Strong borders requires a physical element and deterrent, contrary to the Democrat platform::Deterrent? As in separating parents from children? We must pursue strategies to fix immigration without dehumanizing people. Human dignity is not dependent on where you are born.Ill be frank in what I think should happen. We should maintain a strong presence on the border, while also being more welcoming to refugees escaping violence in South America. Im fine with a pseudo-war against the cartels. But we shouldnt brutalize innocent people.::Your appeals to emotion mean nothing to meThose that break the law and bring their children should be held accountable for doing so. Dont play this, woe is me, nonsense. It's not America burden to bear. They can keep their dignity and wait in line like everyone else::Human rights dont disappear. Youre on the wrong side of history to argue otherwise.I have no shame in insisting that people are treated like people. Youre cruel out of spite towards immigrants. You dont care if we have a working system. The aim of the red-hat immigrant agenda is to maximize taxpayer cost, minimize actual immigration, and violate peoples human rights.I want a strategy that minimizes overall cost to taxpayers, maximizes border security against actual crime like from cartels, and values human dignity. Your resistance to an actual pragmatic approach and insistence on cruel persecution betrays that you really dont care about the issue. You are fueled by hatred.::They dehumanized themselves. Nobody forced them to attempt to illegally enter America, or bring their family with them to illegally enter America. They don't get to stay simply by making the problem worse and having a family with them. You encourage illegal immigration by not just tolerating them, but letting them dictate to you. Why would anyone wait in line when people like you demand that illegals are given citizenship?::Let them dictate to us insomuch that it is universally wrong to brutalize people? We cannot terrorize people regardless of national origin. We can find a middle ground that secures our borders and incentivizes becoming a well-naturalized citizen,And there is no such thing as dehumanizing oneself besides committing heinous crimes. Brutalization is a symptom of authoritative abuses.Moreover, part of the issue is that the line is broken. People get mixed messages from different immigration departments, forms take years to go through, and any mistake is met with overly-severe consequences.Why wait in line if the line never moves?::Moving the goal posts. The issue at hand is people coming here illegally, period. Democratic leadership has also expressed a desire for secure borders. This isnt a partisan issue. as an aside, they didnt link the study they cited, and the study is ridiculously small in scope.::How to be a young, conservative in :*Anything illegal is a crime and criminals deserve a life time in jail!*Also young conservatives:*I smoke weed but that's ok because it shouldn't be a crime*Self-awareness was never their strength.::If the issue was just illegal immigrants then why does Trump and republicans keep wanting to change parts of legal immigration such as family reunification?::Immigration law violations are crimes too. So, no, they are *not* less criminally oriented than their U.S. born peers. Every single illegal immigrant is a de facto criminal by virtue of breaking U.S. immigration laws. That's a % law-breaking record.::Beside the fact that I disagree with you, Id like to point out that labeling people criminals is a way to dehumanize them. What makes a criminal? Shoplifting once when you were ? Driving when you had three beers? Lying on your taxes about the amount of tips you make?Also, when do we consider a criminal not a criminal? Theres no good judgement. If you hit your wife once out of drunken rage years ago but youve been sober since, never hurting anyone, are you still a criminal? Its worth thinking about.We shouldnt call people criminals unless its their actual choice of career.::[deleted]::The penalty for over staying one's visa is deportation. Deportations are not legal consequences that result from abiding by any nation's immigration laws. So, that legalistic hair-splitting lacks merit.::[deleted]::Deportation is the outcome that should apply to those who willingly overstay their visas in an effort to violate U.S. immigration laws. Does this make them criminals? It does to the extent they have broken the nation's immigration laws with malice of forethought.You are most definitely engaging in legalistic hairsplitting with that argument. It is both disingenuous and fraudulent. Crime and criminals are defined by law violations. Your argument rests solely on the penalties that result from that law-breaking while ignoring the law violation entirely. That's what makes it so disingenuous.::&gt; Immigration law violations are crimes too.Actually no they are not. You cannot be criminally prosecuted for being undocumented. Entering the country illegally is a crime, entering the country legally then staying past a visa does not imply that the person committed a crime, just a violation of a civil code. Is it pedantic? Sure, but its the literal interpretation of the law.::The legal penalties for these legal infractions are and should be expeditious deportations. However, you'd think deportation was an execution given the overreaction that illegal immigrants and their advocates display over the practice. One doesn't have to be pedantic to point out the stark differences between deportation and execution.::Omg, hardcore civil infractions! Also, ""criminally oriented"" is one of the sillier phrases Ive seen lately.::You just reminded me that FOXNews made up a crime statistic for (illegal) immigrants. They combined non-violent minor crimes, or stuff like getting pulled over and not being charged with anything, as a crime. And now we have people here who are trying to flip it back around and be like thats breaking da law too. Their arguments are based on lies so the only way they can argue is with bullshit nonsense meant to waste our time.::TIL that I'm ""criminally oriented"" because I jaywalk whenever it's safe to cross against the light.::Get back to us when jaywalking creates the same economic and fiscal consequences that illegal immigration creates. When that day arrives, you'll be as deserving of legal penalties too.::If its so terrible, why isn't it a felony? (Hint: its not, which is why it isn't)::Why isn't illegal immigration a felony? Congress has been bribed by the business community to turn a blind eye to illegal immigration for decades. Establishment Republicans and Democrats are both in the pockets of the oligarchs who want this cheap labor source flooding across the border. Where's the freakin' surprise? You think it's because they give a crap about either illegal immigrants or most Americans? Seriously??!!!::Jerbs::Who gives a shit? What evil criminals they are for coming here, working shit ass jobs for low pay just so they and their families can get ahead.::You should give a shit. Turning a blind eye to wanton violations of U.S. laws is a slippery slope not worth stepping onto. Would you turn a blind eye to attacks against the illegal immigrant community once the American people lose their patience over this ongoing crime? The country can turn a blind eye to that as well.I have no tolerance for any criminal activity whatsoever. Illegal immigration is not an inconsequential crime::It's incredibly likely that at some point in your life you unknowingly (or knowingly) broke some law somewhere. So when are you turning yourself in?::I have never wantonly violated any nation's immigration laws as illegal immigrants have in the U.S. I have also travelled to most of their countries. If I had wantonly violated their country's immigration laws in the same way, then I would have been *as deserving* of the same expeditious deportation consequences they should face in the U.S. You see, unlike their misguided advocates, I don't believe in legal double standards.It is beyond disingenuous to conflate their law breaking and the consequences that result from it with other minor infractions. Minimizing those consequences is outright fraudulent.::&gt;I have no tolerance for any criminal activity whatsoeverI'm only responding to your *exact wording* of *any criminal activity*. Wording you now seem to want to backpedal on.Also, the majority of illegal immigrants have just overstayed visas. That happens to be considered a lesser crime than crossing the border illegally.On top of that, illegal immigrants are great for the private sector where they struggle to employ citizens. Farm work is a big one there. A lot of the food that makes it to tables is due to the contribution of illegal immigrants. They also contribute to society and taxes with ITINs unlike our president who has blatantly bragged about not paying federal income taxes.::That's the conservative lizard brain for you. Unquestioning obedience to authority, living life in a constant state of fear.::That's what you think this is? A blind obedience to arbitrary laws that do not rest on sound immigration principles and practices? Seriously???!!! You think the entire world adopted the same approach to immigration on a lark? Your anarchist approach to life is the most reckless and misguided one there is in life. Quit serving as Charles Koch's pawn by parroting his treasonous and seditious bullshit.::America's version of original sin. Christian nation my ass.::Christianity does not revolve around being a sucker for immigration criminals and grifters.::It revolves around wanting the best for your neighbor, regardless of citizenship.::The problem with your theory is that it assumes illegal immigration solves the inherent problem. It doesn't, as evident by the lack of socio-economic reforms in the countries most illegal immigrants originate from. This lack of progress obliterates your argument.::I mean, lack of socio-economic reforms is probably a reason they're leaving..However, my post was about Christianity. Literally the sermon on the mount.::Most Christians recognize that while the Sermon on the Mount was inspirational, it was also unrealistic. The same is true for your open borders preferences.::Literally the most important teaching of Jesus: ""eh, not that important. Pretty unrealistic imo.""::Jesus didn't really understand the sacrifices he was asking his followers to make. I mean- he lived in poverty and was executed and all- but he could never have foreseen the difficulty of living by his teachings *and* being a model of uncompromising American prosperity- that shit is hard!::I didn't say that speech was unimportant. Instead, I pointed out that there are elements of it that are unrealistic. Have you lived up to what Jesus prescribed in that speech your entire life? Unless your life epitomizes what he laid out, you have no leg to stand on in questioning what I pointed out.I'm not suggesting ignoring that speech altogether, but I am pointing out the futility of harboring unrealistic expectations.::'grifters' lol, okay...::It's a tragic shame truth and reality are so hard for you to deal with in life. Here's [the definition of grifter]() since it has eluded you so far.The fact that the illegal immigrant community and their advocates routinely resort to lies and fraud to champion their cause is as damning as it gets.::Well if that is the standard, then every person who runs a red light or has any other civil infraction is also a criminal.::That's bullshit. Just because you've committed a crime in the past doesn't make you a ""criminal"". I'm sure everyone here has broken the law (whether realizing it or not) at some point. Until someone has been convicted in a court of law, calling them criminals is just plain wrong.::&gt;Just because you've committed a crime in the past doesn't make you a ""criminal"".Yes! It does. Criminals are defined by law-breaking, not by when they committed the crime. Escaping conviction for a crime and the consequences that should result from committing crimes does not make one innocent.Your grasp of rule of law is extremely weak. Your conflicts of interest on the matter stand out like a flashing neon sign.::Smoking weed is still illegal, but we don't call non-convicted weed smokers criminals. I don't see why the terminology should be any different for the millions of undocumented immigrants who haven't been convicted of anything.::Try looking at the stark differences in the economic and fiscal consequences caused by smoking weed vs illegal immigration. That's what you're missing. Illegal immigration is far from being inconsequential. While I can see an objective basis for legalizing weed, I have looked and not found the same objective justification for an illegal immigrant amnesty or turning a blind eye to illegal immigration.::You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.I don't agree with illegal immigration, but I also don't call those millions of people 'criminals' - they're in violation of a laws that aren't enforced properly, and the lack of enforcement creates a humanitarian issue of sending people back to countries where they might not even speak the native language.::&gt;You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. Quit twisting what I wrote. Anyone who smokes weed in a state where that practice is illegal is indeed engaging in criminal behavior. My point was that I can see a justification for legalizing weed, but can not justify condoning illegal immigration or pursuing another illegal immigrant amnesty. Why? There's no sound basis for doing so on behalf of illegal immigrants. As for the moral and ethical implications involved, the federal government is obligated to put the interests of the country and U.S. citizens ahead of the self-serving desires of illegal immigrants. This is perfectly ethical and moral to do so since the responsibility to provide the illegal immigrants community's needs rest with their home countries and governments.&gt;We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.As I've already told you, this judgment call was conducted as objectively as it could be and without the emotional hysteria you are employing on the matter. Your approach to illegal immigration would get wrecked in a court of law while my approach would hold up. Case in point, your hysterical and emotionally charged reference to lynchings. Pull that crap in a court of law and the presiding judge would slap you down for going there.&gt;I don't agree with illegal immigration, but I also don't call those millions of people 'criminals'...Why not? It's what they willingly chose to be in life...outlaws. Would you allow a misguided sense of political correctness keep you from calling a murderer, thief, embezzler, or con man a criminal too? That defies logic and reason.Do you know what actually caused millions of illegal immigrants to flee from Mexico to the U.S.? Neoliberal economic reforms by Mexican politicians, specifically the push for privatization to benefit a select few from NAFTA. Care to guess where U.S. manufacturing and the jobs they once provided went shortly thereafter? Mexico. So, in what universe is it the American people's responsibility to clean up Mexico's idiocy or pad U.S. oligarchs pockets? It's not at all on both ends of this problem.::weed is illegal federally FYI. My whole point is that you don't get to decide who is and isn't a criminal, it's up to the courts. You can call me hysterical if you want, but I suspect you might be projecting.::You do realize that we arent going to deport million people right?::So would that make you a de facto criminal if you were ever speeding?",real
rumoureval_417,Debunk this: Mt. Etna has already put out more than x tbe CO2 than humankind has in its entire existence.,"[deleted]::Then why does the image caption say ""That one little burp""?::[deleted]::You didn't read the caption on the photo. OP is referring to entire existence of humans, not of Mt. Etna. What would it mean entire existence of a mountain anyway? How could one measure the beginning of a mountain? The first grain of sand that built it? There's no plaque ""Established "" on mountains.::[deleted]::Ok I hope you're just trolling at this point::It's clear from the snopes article that this meme is paraphrasing a particular claim by a particular author, and it's fully addressed in the article. It estimates the yearly output of all volcanoes to be about mtons per year, whereas human output about mtons per year. That accounts for several hounded active volcanoes.So that should give OP enough numbers to do some back of the envelope calculations of he really wanted to answer that question, but I don't think that's what he wanted to know. I think you're giving an over-literal interpretation of his words, without taking into account what he likely meant to say.Also even if that is indeed what he meant, it's kinda a silly thing to ask. We have the co2 records going back millions of years, from measuring trapped air bubbles in stone. We've seen co2 get really high, then get lower as plants sequestered it as hydrocarbons. It's all over the place. So it isn't really relevant to ask what the co2 output of a volcano is, because it never really had enough of an impact historically to really be a relevant factor. I. E. if it was highly impactfull, our planet would already be much warmer because volcanos have been around a long time.::OP is asking his question based on the photo, its meant to be the same thing, dumbass::[deleted]::Well what else are you supposed to read when you forget your phone on your way to the shitter?No one has to read shampoo instructions by the way, they're only there cause its legally required in some places. If you were trying to say, ""I bet you're the reason they have to put instructions on shampoo bottles"" then your response makes slightly more sense. It is still extremely stupid though, as your choosing a poorly worded, irrelevant, and blatantly nonsensical attempt at an insult over an actual argument for the point you were trying to make.Altogether, your response has zero relevance with the post or my initial comment so now you just look even more retarded than you did for trying to argue that the picture and the title are not of relation to each other. Let me explain something to you that you seem to not understand. The reason O.P. Is asking the question is because they saw the photo and the numbers sound iffy. It makes no sense that they would have had the question and then found a corresponding photo. The question O.P. asks in the title is meant to be based on what is in the picture; their questions wording doesn't specify that they mean this specific incident but if any sort of common sense is used you can see that they're asking based on a specific incident because thats what is discussed in the photo that leads to the question. I think your confusion is based largely on the last words of the sentence ""in its entire existence"" if you use the photo for context, as that is where the question stems from, its clear that the ""it"" in that sentence is humanity and not the mountain.::Seems irrelevant, since humanity is currently outputting CO2 [at a much higher **rate** than volcanoes ever did](). We are exceeding the capability of sinks to remove CO2 from the atmosphere (at the same time, we are degrading the environment in ways that decrease the capacity of those sinks: [ocean acidification]() and [deforestation]().)::Totally false, and ideologically inspired. We know that, worldwide, volcanoes produce roughly M tons of carbon-12 on average (edit: per year). But we measure *billion* tons of carbon-12 in the atmosphere. The only ""natural"" source of carbon-12 is.... volcanoes. Ergo, the rest is unambiguously produced by human activity.As touched upon by /u/villianboy, this is basically self evident when you consider the absolutely staggering number of carbon-12 producing ""things"" in the world (factories, cars, etc). These carbon-12 producers are active /7 and have been for decades worldwide.::Eh, well for a volcano to outmatch humanity at this point, it'd have to burn a fuck ton of shit, like a super massive metric fuckton. Planes and boats alone make more CO2 than this, let alone cattle farms, cars, humans, and other odd end things",fake

rumoureval_433,"Debunk this: Fluoride declared neurotoxin, causing an adhd and dyslexia pandemic in millions of children worldwide","The title ""Fluoride Officially Classified as a Neurotoxin in Worlds Most Prestigious Medical Journal"" is exceptionally silly. Just being published in the lancet doesn't confer any official status on anything; the same journal later published [criticism]() of that same paper.::The Lancet is also the journal that published the Wakefield paper.::And apologised/retracted it, to be fair to them. I mean, I doubt you'll find a single medical journal, or perhaps any other sort of major journal, that hasn't published some embarassing guff at one point or another. Which is why of course you can't automatically trust what you read in them; of course, in this case it's more egregious because, I would guess by looking at other articles in the 'natural health' section of that site, they're not normally predisposed to accept something just because it's written in the Lancet, or any other medical journal for that matter.::Yeah. You can't take anything at face value without examining it further, no matter the source.::I've not done any research on this, but my cents:In the UK (where I live), there are high-flouride areas in the North (where I happened to grow up), and low-flouride areas in the South.Dentists recognised long ago that there was a regional difference in oral health that exactly matched the natural differences in flouride levels in the local water supplies.Are we supposed to believe that nobody, at the same time, noticed a corresponding adverse effect? There would be distinct correlation between having good teeth and dyslexia/adhd. I find it hard to believe that no one noticed that in the last years.::The dose is the poison. The levels that municipalities fluoridate to have been proven to be safe.::[deleted]::By no means an I an expert on this, so please take this reply with a grain of salt.The lead in municipal water supplies is not added, it comes from the water pipes themselves. Most cities main water pipes were constructed - + years ago and contain a large amount of lead.. even homes built before may contain lead pipes and lead solder. As the pipes corrode lead enters the water supply.The biggest difference between ingesting lead and fluoride is fluoride is water soluble lead is not. So your body will get rid of fluoride (like it does with most things you ingest), lead on the other hand is a heavy metal and your body has no way of dealing with it. Over time, the lead builds up in our system causing toxicity This is known as bioaccumulation.::Its easiest to debunk by reading the actual article.The website refers to this study: . The paragraph on fluoride reads: ""A meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to raised fluoride concentrations.44 Confounding from other substances seemed unlikely in most of these studies. Further characterisation of the doseresponse association would be desirable."" If you click on the reference , it takes you to the PubMed citation for the source of that meta-analysis, and at the bottom of that citation is an exchange between skeptics and the authors (again, more links). Here is selected text from the skeptics ():""Even if we ignore the weaknesses of the study (Choi et al. ), including a lack of individual-level information and the high probability of confounding because the authors did not adjust for covariates, a difference of in mean IQ is clinically negligible (Jeckel et al. ; Rothman et al. ; Szklo and Nieto ) even though it was statistically significant.""So the article on the website makes a big deal about paragraph in a review article (Level evidence, by the way), which refers to a meta-analysis (Level evidence). The biggest issue with the meta-analysis is really that it found a -point drop in IQ, which as the skeptics point out, is clinically negligible even if it is statistically significant.TLR: The Lancet did not declare fluoride a neurotoxin, they published an opinion piece where the authors noted a potential link between fluoride exposure and IQ (not dyslexia and ADHD). The data supporting this link suggest a statistically significant, but clinical unimportant, effect. Debunked.::Best response. As someone with ADHD I was pretty interested in this one. Thanks!!::For starters, lets look at the definition of neurotoxin:&gt;Neurotoxins are substances that are poisonous or destructive to nerve tissue. Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue.To say that fluoride is a a neurotoxin, but it *only* causes ADHD and dyslexia is suspect as fuck.The title itself gives away the likely falsity of the article. Citing chemical name to induce fear? Check. Referencing poorly understood psychological disorders? Check. Mentioning pandemic and children in the same sentence? Double whammy.::One thing ""scare articles"" seldom mention is that fluoridation programs sometimes remove fluoride instead of adding it. The whole thing came about as a result of a condition called ""texas teeth"". Folks in some areas developed unsightly brown stains on their teeth, but those same stained chompers showed marked decreases in decay. The cause was the naturally occurring high level of fluoride in the water. Research was done to find a happy medium between strong teeth and brown ones, and a sort of national standard was picked. So in some spots the water treatment includes *removing it* instead of adding it. Shutting down all fluoridation treatment would also shut down this protection.I'm sure in high enough doses you could hurt yourself with fluoride. At high enough doses you can hurt yourself with water. However even if you're drinking water from an unregulated well in an area with high natural fluoride in it you're unlikely to be harmed by it.My mother was a little girl in England in the aftermath of WWII when fluoride simply wasn't available. My aunt lost all her teeth as a teenager. My mother kept hers but doesn't have one without serious dental work in it. Mine aren't perfect but a LONG way from either of those scenarios. My childhood was soaked in fluoride, both from school ""treatment"" programs and at home in the form of toothpastes. I may be a bit nerdy but I don't think I've suffered neurological trauma from it.",fake

Buy salt regularly or keep it in a sealed container.::Edit: we've found this comment to likely be technically incorrect.Iodine does not evaporate from iodized salt. It is not simply liquid iodine doused on salt. Iodine is a basic element and it has various forms. Iodized salt has a small amount of iodine *in-salt-form* added to the regular salt.::It turns out that iodine does decrease in table salt: highest iodine losses were recorded in table saltstoring.

They will have somewhere on the label that says, ""does not contain iodide, a necessary nutrient."" Almost every form of table salt in any restaurant and the most popular brand, Morton's does not contain iodide. This is as easily verifiable as going to the store. My parents have different types of salt in their house, my grandparents have different types and not one of them contain iodide. I was surprised this was the case because that's literally the whole point of salt, to supply iodide. I use (actual) Himalayan pink salt, and Mediterranean sea salt. Both contain not only iodide but a bunch of other naturally-occurring minerals as well. I also take one drop of sublingual iodine every morning which helps the functions of your thyroid gland. Thyroid is one of the glands located at the throat chakra and in the last -8 months I've taken it, I've noticed a drastic increase in my ability to communicate my ideas.

But fluoride too. And people still think it somehow helps their teeth. because water treatment isn't so centralized; gotta dose the people somehow.And you know fruit is loaded with Vitamin C, right? More evidence that we're designed to eat fruit and don't run so great on incorrect diets.::you can get vitamin C from raw meat, also. This is why Inuit and Northern peoples didn't die of scurvy on a traditional diet of raw whale and fish::We evolved as omnivores, but I do agree with you that people don't run great on bad diets. I don't think it's just malnutrition that is the culprit because the more I learn about gut flora the more I think that maybe some of the stuff in our diet is feeding the wrong bacteria inside of us.::Your diet modifies your gut bacteria, and different gut bacteria have different impacts on health.::We evolved for % of our existence, prior to the invention of fire and tools, as frugivores. You can simply look at our body's digestive system and it's self-evident, just as you can look at a cow's digestive system and tell it's designed to eat grass rather than meat. Perhaps we really did live for + years until people started straying from that natural diet as omnivores and thereby damaging their bodies.Probiotics are helpful for cultivating a healthy (for you) gut flora, but make sure you're cultivating the *right* bacteria. Sourcrout, for example, contains plant-eating bacteria whereas kambucha contains sugar-eating bacteria. Dunno about you, but I don't need encouragement to eat sugar.::The sugars most people get in their diet is terrible, not just the kinds but the amounts. I think even recently studies were suggesting that c.diff was being made worse through an alternative to sucrose. I really doubt the + years thing because we were also prone to infections, parasites, etc... There might be, or was at one time, humans with the right genetics to live that long but I don't really think so.As for probiotics, you definitely need to do a little bit of homework to avoid wasting your money. Just like various supplements, the claims made by the companies making them can be misleading.::There are protections against parasites, too, that have evolved in various cultures -- vodka, wormwood, dandelion, fasting... Man I think they had all this handled. We're just been made to forget it.::pumpkin seeds::Ayahuasca is an anti parasitic drug/compound.

Thanks!::Yeah all those fruits were delicious in the winter.::You do realize there are plenty of fruits that are harvested in winter.. we even called them 'winter fruits'.. lol::Yes most plants can't form fruit below degrees Fahrenheit. There was an Ice age in progress. The human brain developed because of meat which is what separated us from our ape buddies.. This is a well established theory. Our guts even point to this.::I'd say the Stoned Ape Theory is more credible an explanation for the why the capacity of the human brain doubled in size over a few hundred million of years vs. just eating meat.::one tidbit of info that may be related to topic: the human brain is made of omega3 fatty acids. There are types of omega3: ALA, EPA, and DHA. The brain is made from DHA. There is only one natural source of DHA: algae, and fish that eat algae. Walnuts, flax seeds, etc are NOT DHA.Many people, especially males and older people, do not convert food sources of ALA to DHA very efficiently. In these cases the body will incorporate nonDHA fatty acids into the membrane of the brain. However there is at least some evidence that this leads to suboptimal results like emotional or mood issues, attention issues, or anger issues. However the specifics are widely debated[]()::Oh yeah I don't deny that we are meat eaters by nature I just thought it was a bit odd to insinuate there isn't fruit in winter. And plenty of the world never gets to f by the way. I'm pretty sure humans were living in the warmest of places(like around the equator) for a long time before they started living in places that got that cold.::It's warm year-round in the tropics. Lots of fruit here too. See how this works? Humans are a tropical species. When we left this ""Garden of Eden"", we had to eat the wrong foods for our species -- largely, meat. That's when we started destroying our bodies. Not saying we shouldn't have done it, but there were consequences.Nowadays we have supply chains, so we don't have to eat just whatever we can get our hands onto. We can get back to a proper diet and starve our this medical industry that's arisen to support our failing bodies.::Even if you wanted to eat an all fruit diet, the fruit of today isn't the same as the fruit from our earliest ancestors. Hell even comparing the fruit of today to two hundred years ago will bring foward a bunch of differences.We have selectively grown fruit in the same manner as livestock. Fruits properties are totaly different to what they were.::Gonna depend on where you live, certainly, but even if fruit is different than years gone by it's still the *most* similar to our ideal diet. People use your logic as a reason to go straight carnivore, as if it's an all-or-none kinda thing. You do the best you can. You don't just through up your hands, say fuck it, and not even try... unless you're willing to accept the health consequences, that is.::we evolved with a chronic b12 deficiency?::B12 isn't made in meat.It's supplemented in the diet of farm Animals so everyone doesn't end up B12 deficient.B12 is actually a bacteria that exists in the dirt but due to industrial agriculture gets destroyed by pesticides. If you were a frugivores under natural conditions you wouldn't have a B12 deficiency. Over % of B12 supplements on the planet go to the animal agriculture industry. Do your research.::Nah, occasional eggs were on the menu too. Chickens love fruit scraps. Almost everybody in rural Costa Rica has chickens. Free eggs, every day; they'd be stupid not to. I can't imagine early humans would have ignored this food source. But without fire, there's no way they ate the whole, raw, feathery chicken when mangoes, bananas, and papayas were readily available.::No but there is plenty of red meat that is easily eaten raw. Even chimps and other apes will eat raw red meat.::Go kill a deer... or, let's make it easy, a cow with your bare hands. Now eat it with no tools, including no fire. Put it on YouTube.

You must take it upon yourself to eat correctly and figure out what is safe for you to use. walk in any major grocery store and take a look around at the people shopping there. Something is off the rails that many large people in the same place use to be a spectacle and not the norm. Organic food is worth the effort and or the price. there are a few foods that will give you enough iodine. dried seaweed has the highest amount . Things like Eggs and Cod also have iodine but not as much. only cook in cast iron and store items in unleaded glass containers.Never use plastic for anything that you consume. hygiene items are a major cause of high estrogen in men. so many chemicals get cocktailed together and cause an endocrine disruption.they make products that are safe to use but they are not sold in normal stores.

This is the ideal situation.::I agree but in my experience there are far more brands of non-iodized versus what should be the standard iodized with just a few non's. /shrug::Because most ""fancy"" salt or salt meant for a specific purpose isn't iodized. You only really find general purpose table salt and some sea salt to be iodized. But again, that makes sense. People who buy their fancy Himalayan pink salt don't want added iodine because they want the pure ""natural"" chemicals or whatever. People who bake with salt don't general want added iodine because it can impart an off flavor when baked. Same for people who want to do brines. And so on. Never the less, % of the salt sold is the cheap table salt variety which does contain iodine. The number of products does not tell you what people buy. There is only one cheapest brand of anything, and yet most people will buy that. We have options to buy both easily because there are good reasons to buy both. That is a good thing. In general, the more choices you have the better. If the government starts a smear campaign against iodized salt, sure. Or if you find it impossible to buy iodized salt or other iodine supplements all of a sudden than sure. But the fact that we have a choice is not a cause for worry. Instead, worry when your choices are being made for you.::Buy Kelp pills. They have the iodine you need.

Do you have an example?::My friend told me that we have to pay taxes to use the dollar as currency because the fed isn't a gov agency::[deleted]::I heard we are charged to use federal reserve notes aka the US dollar as a form of currency::to use a dollar bill - no.... behind the scene taxes/fees - of course! cuz... 'Murica::No, like we are taxed as a country to use the USD::not to use or hold the bill - but everything else associated with that same bill... earn in? taxed. spend it? taxed. saved? taxed... other than physically handling the dollar bill, I can't come up with one way that it isn't taxed (other than putting it in a jar and burying it in your back yard or living in a completely tax-free state).

I heard a portion of income tax is collected as a charge for the use of Federal Reserve notes as US money. Which I'm guessing would be a whole lots o monies::Federal taxes are used to physically create our currency, but no, there is no fee or tax explicitly for using the US dollar or any other US currency. Sales taxes would be the closest thing to what you're thinking of.::The way it was explained to me is that our gov asked for all dollars used in circulation as kinda a loan, and was provided by the fed w interest. And it was this interest that we as citizens are charged. This charge comes out of our federal taxes::Taxes",unverified
