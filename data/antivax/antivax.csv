The vaccine-mRNA has been modified to a form never before seen in nature, and manipulated to ensure stability and delay enzymatic digestion.::Obviously, because there are so many unknowns, this is exactly why fully completed wide ranging studies are required to be completed before subjecting humans to risk from unknown harms.::It is likely that the vaccine-mRNA will be found in EVs, however, we do not know if fragmented and/or EV-free parts could make it into the plasma and breast milk, potentially protected by complexing with proteins such as Ago2.::We have no idea if it will contribute to gut issues, it has already been shown that breastmilk EVs and miRNAs bioaccumulate in the brain, and those that do not, alter gene regulation in the gut.::Extracellular, EV encapsulated, or fragmented vaccine-mRNA, if not digested, will like be recognised as DAMPS (damage associated molecular patterns) by the innate immune system, and initiate inflammatory signalling cascades. This clearly would not be good for a nursing baby.::How do we know that fragmented versions of these non-natural enhanced mRNAs are not biologically active, much in the same way as miRNA and siRNA is clear there is still so much unknown, which means there can be no assurances of safety.::This challenges the claim that the vaccine-mRNA is rapidly degraded.::Furthermore, RNA has been found in a highly stable vesicle-free form in the bloodstream, complexed with proteins such as Argonaute2 (Ago2) which protect them from digestion by RNase enzymes.::::MicroRNAs and mRNA have been detected in human breast milk, and shown to survive passage through the stomach, protected from enzymatic digestion and acidic conditions, maintaining their biologically active capabilities.::Benefit.

Im very confident about that::got my nd AstraZeneca jab yesterday!::Hes gonna be pissed as F I meant to say::Dude with all due respect, Ive already analyzed the next MK movie!

I feel pressure tho.::YAsSsSssSsssSSS QuEeN!!!!! XD::But what is normal??? I dont think there is a normal. Were always changing and yearn for an old normal that isnt necessarily good now.::Dude Unplug ur ear holes. Theres no excuse why these characters couldnt be amazing. Ever play injustice? Ever play as Hawkgirl? That could easily be Nitara. MK doesnt even have a character who flies midair or plays like that. Ppl like Hawkgirl. They can like Nitara too.::from the d era and from the d era::Same a perfect pack that unifies d era and d era fans should have SmokeHavikReptileSareenaGuest This pack alone could possible unify the factions::VCCNs ARE DANGEROUS!Dr. said: ""You are going to go to your doom!"". says: ""Everyone vcned will die on Autumn""::Ok thats ur opinion but people want this to happen so respect peoples opinions or simply get ur ass out of here::Thats the worst from the franchise top worst MK games::In other cases if u like it cool if u dont like also cool but atleast dont be a bitch about it and grow the fuck up you donkey::Ya know bacho is a more respected nitara fan than u ur just making ur people look bad::Man, is this a joke?

If you want the vaccine, go and get it, I'm not going to twitter you to death you daft melons.::Is done? Are you finished with it? Are you working on other projects now? Is there no more dlc? Is injustice your next project? WE WANT ANSWERS::::Who knows? Its to ridiculously long since we have had new content. I think u r misunderstanding me. I like all the characters u want. I really do. I am just tired of them and dont want them in every single game. I want to see change and new variety. But take care anyway.::Same!!!::we are arguing for something that is likely to not even exist, because the next game dc vs Marvel on the way of things is real, what we have left is to ask, and hope that we are heard, what I am beginning to doubt is::::No ones talking about politics. Let me give you an example. U judge Nitara as boring. Maybe bc in the D era they didnt have technology to make her fly. Today they do. Nitara could play like Hawkgirl. MK doesnt have character who plays like that. Ppl like Hawkgirl. Y not her?::to start you came out of your bully rock with characters chosen by someone else who has nothing to do with you::instead of staying in yours and going to ask for your characters comes in the comments of others criticizing their dejection, I dont know in your country, but in mine this is very impolite with others, you have the right not to like it, each in his corner::Bro, u are so fucking trash::There are fans. Ignorant people judge a slew of characters over gameplay. That was the issue. Not the characters themselves. We dont have joker in every single Batman movie now do we? Why? It would be boring. Try again. Or better yet go back under your rock.::why do you people feel the need to label drop EVERYTHING?? Just say you got vaccine and there's absolutely no need for this petty pfizer/ moderna / jj label war bs.::if there really were so many fans they wouldn't have been in the fridge for years, but it's just a small audience::Whatever you say. Ive been waiting for years. Lets see if youre still a fan or even still playing MK after that long like I am. I wonder if youd survive waiting that long without your dear favorites.::wrote, wrote and cried like a child::I am asking for my favorites, thanks. I am being an adult. An adult has compassion and empathy and isnt selfish and unappreciative. A spoiled immature brat is otherwise. An adult thinks outside the box and doesnt want the same constantly. Try again.::What the context of vaccine and flat earth? You're this brain dead? Just go talk to a doctor what he has git to say about vaccines. A lot doc in Germany don't support this shit that's going on. In addition to that go look up some Statistik. Snowflake::so learn to ask for your favorites and less criticize those of others, stop being boring, going to the comments of others criticize the tastes of others, be an adult::Your argument is flawed. We want our characters in D. Youve had that luxury. We havent. Get over it. Youre not the only MK fans. Youve had your characters. Learn the concept of gratitude.::The truth is there's no ""going back to normal"". After everyone is vaccinated they'll come with ""oh nooo the vaccines don't work against strains haha guess we gotta do everything over again...""::Oh for sure, and some people are just waiting it out to see if there's any long term issues with the vaccines themselves. But, there's also an issue with people who just can't get it (outside of America), such as with India just getting demolished by vaccine production.::Please Ed, please::Please Ed sektor, cyrax, reptile, ermac And smoke::New dlc please::Go play Armagedon::My daughter said It should not call Mortal Kombat it should be called immortal Kombat Because everybody has powers lol::% is a political number (something said to instruct/calm the public) seeing as how the majority of are asymptomatic.

No. The covid don't justify the fact that the whole team has been ignoring the fans. So argue with the wall.::You think its easier or harder to create content with offices closed?::Tons of people die from the flu and vaccination isnt just for you, it protects everybody. If you catch the virus you can infect people who cant be vaccinated and it can also mutate in you and become resistant to vaccines::Ohhh there it is::::Brazil far from reality::im way to woke for that.::I dont care if you do or dont but people like you need to stop spreading misinformation. You guys are not doctors or experts no matter how badly you think you are. I will listen to doctors and scientists over a bunch of randoms on twitter.::Just turn off the TV and it's back to normal. Many states are back normal and doing better than locked down ones.::&gt; Your experience isn't everyone'sdude that is EXACTLY why people should get the vaccine, because not everyone is going to come out of it without long term issuesFurthermore the contagious phase doesn't show any symptoms and you could be endangering others::The vaccine isnt a cure. It can only help prevent it. If you use common sense and be safe, you should be fine. The sad thing is many self entitled spoiled ass Americans feel as if they are above all that bc freedomz.::created so quick? You do realize Covid has been around and didnt just pop up in . It came to humans in . Scientists and Drs have had plenty of information to look to not to mention SARS &amp; . You sound moronic. Smart people get their flu-shot.::Average joe rogan listener::Yeah well advocate for em::We'll do that when you guys decide to tell is what you're doing to keep the game alive.::Imagine that, could have fooled me::Eh who knows. But many many people will not get it. Many don't trust it.::Young healthy people have died from covid. Please educate yourself before you regret it.::The word you are looking for is ""Booster"".::A MK character named needles needs to have a friendship that forces a vaccine, now who in the MK universe would be antivax, can only be used on them.::Some people in the comments I had to block them all, there so fucking angry that some people are choosing not to have it::Exactly. I'd be willing to bet many of the same ppl pushing the vaccine dont get the flu shot::Lmao at . Fkn::Ok mr mkfighter have a good night::Clearly you are lol because you are trying to get people to listen to your crack pot theories. If you really didn't care you wouldnt have said anything at all. People like you think you are experts but i would rather listen to actual doctors and scientists over some random baby.::True::Too late::I know, no one dies from the flu. Look, all I'm saying is I don't want the government to force anything on anyone. If you want to take it, take it. If you don't, don't::Had fun with you lot tonight and now Im going to block you with a smile on my face I hope you lot manage to get out sometime.::I give it months.::She married down.::Got my last Vaccine yesterday, also Pfizer.::Thank you. You crazy little kids and your NFT's. Good thing it doesn't require a basic education in reading and writing huh?::Wife, oh and thanks for the fashion lesson.::Yes and the same goes with you and others that really want people to get the vaccine. You can't have it only one way::You can't. Well that isn't surprising.::Well done, you found the correct emoji. BTW, next time your girlfriend dresses you, throw out the bright yellowish tie. Your dress sense is almost as bad your understanding of the English language.::or we can get back to normal and stop pretending covid is the worse disease in existence.::Blocked?!?!?!::Sorry no?!::CYRAX. SEKTOR. REPTILE. ERMAC.SMOKE.::ohhhhh well done::Can y'all stop harassing him about a damn game but instead worry about health::::Mad?!?!??::Its in the article. Can you not read?::Bore off u weirdos::You're*. I'd understand if English wasn't your first language, but now I just think you're stupid. Yes, I'm also a gaming mag editor in chief. That's called a real job.::I cant find anything that says % less likely to catch the virus sir????::Man just shut up::No need to cry kiddo::Your sad and pathetic that you are that interested in whether other people are taking the vaccine. Fuck off::Rest of us, no. Your elderly and sick relatives definitely. Links are in the article.::Typing actually::I got moderna yesterday and Im having a shit day of side effects::And your an adult gamer::Show me the source for that % and Ill consider having it to save the rest of you?!::No, I'm writing. I would call you a moron, but I think it might be too big a word for you to grasp.::Going off topic like always I see. Point is a vaccine helped society push thru a pandemic over years ago. Itll do the same again. Luckily for your peanut brain having ass, herd immunity will help you stay healthy.::They said we will need another shot after months. Youre already living the new normal::How about you kill off Dvorrah one the next MK game then Ill give a thumbs up::You still talking??::That dosn't mean you'll have the same experience as him/his daughters::I know right. And doctors used to smoke while doing surgery and doctors were saying cigarettes weren't harmful. True::Will that really get us back to normal again?Or will we just be stepping further into constructs that limit our rights and risk our health?I wouldn't be surprised if there is literally an evil sorcerer behind the curtains of some of these productions.::Getting my second shot next week.::I'm not a doctor::Its not His fault personally,I know that if he had the chance to talk about the character or add him he would have done that already but NRS &amp; WB and whom ever else is responsible should talk(apologize)if he isnt going to make it,the game isnt done yet I think,so we Wait&ampee::I can't take your insensitivity.::Well he is smart and he doesn't have great conversations with doctors and many smart people. But the point about rogan was to state the facts regarding his personal experience. Nothing more::How odd is it that this is a + year old newspaper ad right?::Tell that to my former coworker that was young and healthy lost his life two weeks ago from covid after being in hospital for days. Left behind kids and one on the way next month. Grow up doctor::with talks of marvel vs. DC brewing, it would be awesome to see a strictly SUPER VILLIAN INJUSTICE MARVEL VS DC::Yeah man, rogan is a beacon of knowledge and everyone should definitely listen to him::They got the vaccine. Can they come to mk11?::Kombat pack VKombat pack VKombat pack::Damn it must be hard for you. I hope everything will be OK. Keep your head up.::Damn man and you used the R word. You can day it was for me all you want but I know the truth. Not cool::non::Thats crazy to even say. Every day on YouTube, pandora, so many times I'm bombarded by ads of doctors and just djs saying to take it.::Im pretty sure the full vaccine expires in a year. Hopefully we can be done by now::PLEASE BRING BACK DICK TRACY!!!! HE'S WAAAY OVERDUE FOR AN APPEARANCE!!!::Super, tu peux annoncer le KP3 maintenant ?::I get it bro, youre brain dead.

Cause news flash dawg, VACCINES helped society get thru that pandemic. Why are vaccines so taboo out of a::I'm just curious what you based your opinion on::True::English is not my first language, yet this conversation is not about proper spelling.

If you do then fine go right ahead. No? Cool::Shutcho I only care about myself so I dont want to help others ass up. I exercise too goofy. The point of the vaccine is to prevent me, someone who caught covid from passing it on to someone who isnt quite resilient to covid in general. Why is so hard to get that thru your::Bring back smoke and ermac please::""normal"" for like months or the next level mutation... and then it starts from the beginning... I bet what happen in india we will see in the future in much other countries...::I'm fine with that!::True::Ok sir, but did you red any article on science related site? Or did you red any thesis, which made you think critically and choose not to take vaccine and try to convince everybody else? i hope you did a research? right???::Calls someone a melt, doesn't know how to spell you're::Thats adorable. I listened and read many things before you said what he said.::Game::Actually, no. Depending on the vaccine, you are up to % less likely to catch it or have any symptoms. Not having it, you risk spreading it to those at higher risk of long haul C19::If only you could spell::No thanks, I'll do fine without blood clots a heart attacks, thank you.::True::Yes.::I'm still waiting and I'm high risk.::Aw thats so cute. Anti covid vaccine? Yeah. Unless you're old and have health conditions::Umm goodbye followers??::Fuck you::::as long there will be People that Test the Vaccin for free aslong there will be Studys how effective it is, the People dont get paid to get Vaccine im not against that if you work in a Hospital but if that only help for a couple of Months its not a straight Solution::Many people don't get the flu shot just to point that out. So not everyone will get the vaccine. People that are % for the vaccine don't get this. Nothing should be forced on us. Especially something that was created so quick that we have no clue the future ramifications::Ok bye::We are fine with not getting a vaccine until you're convincing people not to take it and spreading fake news.::Yay! Hope the symptoms arent hitting you too hard Ed!::Rogan is insanely healthy and a lot older than and he didn't get it while his entire family got it. His daughters had a little cough or nothing much. His wife is fine. Oh but forget about them because it doesn't fit the narrative::He didnt even complain bye::If only you have red a single article about this virus you'd know that if you get infected, long story short your immune system turns against you::Here's what's missing::I know of him. He is young and healthy. But you have to account for the fact that he might have been cutting lots of weight or being so exhausted all the time does effect how any sickness effects you. Any.::Not saying covid is the reason he died, just that it was a shame he did.::No worries, his dose will be used on someone who actually needs it and values his, and most importantly, other's life.::Exactly! We need to kick this thing so we can go back to cons and hear officially announce Mortal Kombat: Injustice!::if you do some research about the Vaccine, Doctors say it holds ur Imunesystem up for couple of Months so in that case yep you have to do it over and over, i heard about a Nosespray that they want to introduce so the Virus cant dock on ur breathing Areas when inhaleing the Virus::A coworker of mine passed while having covid. But he also had different blood cancer, was overweight, and an alcoholic. It's a shame he passed, he was a great guy. But the deck was stacked against him way before covid.::I know so many people that had it and were fine, including my mum, I know one, just one that was bad. So Ill go off what I see. Not what other people are telling me!!!::I did get it and I was good. I'm healthy and exercise. Your experience isn't everyone's.::So you're ok with a possible long term side effects after Covid, a virus we are still learning new things about, and which is mutating in real time? But you don't trust a thing that's made by human scientists who spent so much time in developing and researching this vaccine? wtf::Tell us your a melt without telling us your a melt = you::gotta love theyre special.::you do you bro, Im not worried about what you choose to do.::The only way you get that is if they release another Armageddon style game which is unlikely. No love for Kira and ashra tho btw?::Good point. Got me::If you want to get it, fine. Don't push that shit onto me or anyone else that is skeptical about having something forced into their body that no one knows the long term effects::Yeah but more than likely, you'll be fine or get sick and be fine after. No one knows the long term effects of this vaccine. The j+j was had to be stopped because blood clots. But the fda and scientists said this is good to go. Best thing to do is exercise and stay healthy::This dude doesnt know science! If everyone gets their damn vaccine we get heard immunity and can go back to normal. Will covid be completely gone? No but this will help it drastically. With shots every year after just like the flu shots.::I just got over covid. It wasn't bad at all. Also I refuse to take an experimental drug. Here's my vax card::::ok but hurry up Ed boon whe need announcements kombat pack::You didn't answer my question. And it doesn't just affect old people there is a year old UFC fighter who is in amazing shape and he still almost died from covid. He said it was the worst sickmess he ever had and it almost made him retire.::Yes please!::Fatality... but in a good way, of course::::mortal kombat vs killer instinct is normal okay?::Cuck::Those characters belong in the ""Reiko Orchestra"" good job!::Oh fuck off you clown.... my mum had covid December and I was with her the whole time, at the hospital, before the doctors even knew it was covid. So run along::no thanks. Go play MKX. We deserve characters we havent seen for a change::king behavior::The whole young and healthy means you will be fine is a bunch of bullshit! There is a UFC fighter names chemieve who is in amazing shape but he still almost died from covid. He said it was the worst sickness he ever had it was so bad he almost retired because of it.::If you need that explaining then go back to school. If I was obese, old or vulnerable I might have the vaccine too, but Im not. Sooooo::Mileena skin::::If they have to re vaccine doesn't that just make this like any other flu shot?::Nah, I'll pass! I don't trust the science.::How is he guilt tripping you? Sounds like you are guilt tripping yourself you cry baby.::As if it were as Easy as in the US. They call it the third world.::Just got my second ! Lets goo::I got my first one yesterday and the second one may th.::Typical stupid Republican. Party of insanity::Yes.

Its utter madness!!!!::Are you framing a craze that some people challenge vaccine safety by stating that a new craze for tests are emerging?::What about the discrimination about the vaccine? Is that a medical act that someone should not be coerced in doing?

This test is rarely used because it is more expensive and more time-consuming. /n::) A (+) Antibody test is a clear indication that you've had COVID but a (-) antibody test does not rule out that you've had COVID. Antibodies wane off over a months period. They are no longer detected after that although you would be still immune to COVID. /n::There isn't a single test that can tell you if you have already had COVID with % certainty.1) A (+) PCR test with characteristic symptoms is more likely to indicate that you've had COVID2) A (+) PCR test without symptoms cannot clearly determine that you've had COVID /n::Fever is an inflammatory response that fights off any invader by activating the immune system or hindering the activity of the invader. The body can also launch a specific immune response with cells that target specific invaders. These can be measured to show immunity. /n::Here's a simplistic display of immunity levels.There are immune barriers that protect the body from invaders. If the invader manages to go past them, the body launches a non-specific response. For-example phagocytes are cells that can attack any invader. /n::A new testing craze is being unleashed.People are asking me which test can I use to prove that I got COVID. There isn't an easy answer. The immune system is complex and can take care of a virus through multiple mechanisms sometimes without leaving a trail of evidence. /n",1

Take out the bureaucratic delays, and it's an efficient system.::The core elements of the vaccine have been used for several other vaccines for over years.

Its just a vaccine that helps you not get sick enough where you end up in the hospital. creating a pandemic. Hospitals arent overflowed and the ones who DO get deathly sick can get attention without crippling the healthcare system.::Then once your cells express the protein, helper T cells and memory B cells do their job, see a glimpse of the virus, just enough to create antibodies and the next time you get exposed, you wont get sick enough to end up in the hopsital. Its not a cure, like the flu shot.::The spike protein it calls for is broken down by enzymes (because its huge) and only peptides are expressed on the surface. ONLY LIVER CELLS can uptake this mRNA due to the specificity of the nanoparticle its transported by. Your cells dont let just anything inside.::If you look at Modernas site, theyve been in phase trials for mRNA based therapeutics for years now as well.

We shall see what happens...::Vaccines where they inject you with live or inactive parts of the virus. And like some have said, funding is usually the biggest slow down when it comes to developing these. Not a huge issue when the whole world is looking for it.::The base of the vaccine was in the works for years before COVID. It wasnt rushed, it was adjusted to suit.::While mRNA may seem new cause nobody has really heard about it, its been under development for decades. Essentially what it does is give your body specific instructions on what to do if it detects the protein from any virus really. Which should be safer than the older /2::Everyone understands why it was ""rushed"" or fast-tracked, right? Going another year or two without a vaccine while we study long term effects means s of millions more dead from this virus thanks to its ease of transmission and our lack of collective will power. We needed it.::The testing for approval is very specific, has multiple steps, and must be demonstrably safe. The methods in which it is produced, manufactured, tested, even administered, must be evaluated. The entire process from start to finish is strictly regulated. The vaccine is safe.::Took my first dose back in December. Taking the second this week. Just sore arm after taking it. My co-workers said they had little fatigue.::I work in a long term care facility and that was my thoughts exactly.Plus the vaccines have been and still are under extensive peer review so there is some accountability going on.Ill keep you all posted if I grow a tail in five years though.::The only thing that isn't very well known is how long does the immunity lasts. The vaccine works and is based on a very smart mechanism thats been studies for dacades. It's cutting edge, no doubt about that.::In my time we were use to test different meds. So as far as I believe, I'm done being a test subject. As for anyone wanting to take it, I have no issue and can say nothing about it.::Well mixed feelings. I am gonna get it regardless because I'm a type one diabetic and the survival rate is slim to none. But it has me nervous and scared at the same tho.. but I promise you, I'll get it asap. Itll make life so much easier ... I'm with you on this one.::Fact DC wants to hide the fact their forcing it on kids is a huge red flag. I already had covid19 I'm good on not receiving a vaccine that they dont even know if it works. Also this vaccine is extremely rushed without long term studies on future side effects.::idk. tbh, if there's any one single obvious trend, I'm pretty sure if I get the vaccine it will subconsciously make me lazy and I'll contract a variant strain when I'm not looking, ie I go out regularly and have managed to keep it off of myself since before ""day one"".::Not precisely: the Pfizer and BionTech vaccine works on a ~ year old development, messenger RNA. Other vaccines are based on even older and astablished sciance. But both are used for decades::The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is based on a tried and tested method of vaccine development. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine alters your RNA. This type of vaccine has never been tried before and the long term effects are unknown. I would prefer the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.::no early vaccine test bunny. no sir.::IIRC there are other vaccine candidates in the works using older methods, and they'll likely sink or swim by their effectiveness vs the front runners. If you can afford to wait and see, then wait and see. The available evidence says that the new jabs are safe, though. /2::So covid isn't a real threat?::I would just like to add, there are a lot of unknown side effects to getting covid. To me I think covid side effects are worse than what the vaccine could potentially cause side effect wise.::I live with my elderly grandparents. Run me that vaccine asap.::It's not so much that the several covid vaccines have been rushed vs others, we're just benefitting from advances in the tech available to analyse the virus and respond + economy of scale; it's such a widespread threat there's no shortage of patients, funds and exposure. /2::Youre young and healthy are you not. Vaccine should go to others first. Yes its hasty and new, and most governments protect vaccine makers from lawsuits. But intentionally unsafe would do no one any good. Normal vaccines contain risk, how much extra risk is vaccine versus covid::Being two things, on twitter?! But you have to be extreme, all of the time!Naw, it makes sense to me.::At the very least wait a few months to see how other people have been with it. Since there seems to be a slow rollout of the vaccine I feel like this is a lot easier to do.::The reason they're fast tracked is many companies are doing them so peer review is faster. They aren't having to beg and wait for funding and they are using previous similar vaccines info to build this one. They are NOT cutting corners to get this out.::I work in a nursing home so I'm taking the vaccine. Any possible negative effect to me is outweighed by the positive of improving the quality of a hundred other lives.::As far as I have heard, the Covid vaccine has been better tested than most other vaccines. More funding, higher priority, more test candidates. Also: possible side effects in line with other vaccines.I will surely get it as quickly as possible.::That is the stance you should take. It could be very beneficial but there can be unforeseen consequences::Not as indisputably good for you as bananas though.::I received the vaccine. I work in a hospital almost filled with Covid patients. I want to protect myself and protect my loved ones when I leave::I am in the same boat. Historically Vaccines have taken -10 years to produce, test and know the effects of things more long term. -10 months??? Yea it may work, but no ones going to know the side effects for years to come. Thats why I wont be getting it anytime soon.::I'm from Cambridge in the UK (where there's a huge scientific community) We've had reassuring justification from fact checked sources. It makes sense to me that the cumulative effort directed towards this has resulted in the Phizer and Oxford vaccine being widely held as safe.::Let's hope it works better than Cyberpunk .::Just shoot me up and get it over with. I find it funny their happens to be a new strain of covid just as the vaccine is coming out, seems like fear mongering now.::This research has been years in the making. Especially after the SARS outbreak. This is cutting edge method that will likely change how most vaccines are handled. You should read up on mRNA::Agreed, do feel like it's being rushed, not that it isn't safe it's like and new gaming system. It's going to have bugs in the first gen. So you rather wait until those bugs are worked out until getting it::By the time you get a crack at it, youll have months or so of stats on a larger test population::I have a friend who got it and she had some symptoms but they lasted about a day and a half. Still though it was something::I think the main vaccines are fine. Weve just literally never had a situation exactly like this.::Im the same Im glad that their is a vaccine but will it work on the new strain thats out there. I just thank more info and results need to be shared.::After feeling like that myself, on reflection I've decided that If they offered it to me I'd have it without any hesitation. It is still a concern but I think for me it would be a risk worth taking. I completely understand &amp; respect that others will feel completely different::I'm with you on this, the vaccine was rushed and what scares me is not knowing if your going to have an allergic reaction to it.::well covid is literaly killing people all over the place or giving poeple health problems they ll keep for life. meanwhile doctors working on the vaccine are trying to save lifes not hurt people.::I do find it disturbing that some testing has been skipped, it is there for a reason, however i do also think that slowing down the spread is important..But yea when theres more testing on my shampoo than the vaccine, i do get a little worried as well..::I only take vaccines for real threats like tetanus, I wouldn't take the covid vaccine even if I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that its % safe for the same reason I don't buy grenade launcher.::while I understand your apprehension, the vaccine is piggybacked off prior vaccines we've all taken..you've taken a plethora of em since birth imagine all the ingredients you eat/put in your body you can't pronounce cuz it's ""food"" I think they're safe::I'm in the same position on it myself. I'll wait and see how it plays out before I decide to get it or not.::I work at a supermarket, so Im considered an essential worker as Ive worked continuously since the pandemic began, but Im not going to take the vaccine for the reasons you said. Theres too many unknowns about the long term side effects.::I'm not getting it, at least not yet. Don't know what kind of side effects there are, and I already have a fucked up immune system thanks to my blood disorder::Lol::Do you want to be the only without a tail ??::The vaccine hasnt been out long enough to know that its safe. imo::Honestly Im nervous as hell about it. But I also have a child who no doubt will need it eventually. So for that I dont want her to be the guinea pig. I decided Im going to get it so I know how it will be for her.",0

The stocks they purchased are now sent to India because they were not approved to be administered in the US.::How do you know when Pfizer deliveries are arriving? I have been wanting this information for ages.::that million in reality is only million people.We all need two doses::In reality thats only million that have been vaccinated.I would have thought that someone in the medical profession would be more accurate.It sounds to me like you want to pump up the number of people vaccinated.::Yes. We had received over million doses by Mar , but dispensing them took a whole month! By Anzac day we had received million. Pfizer are steadily delivering ahead of expected schedule.::::Yes how any people in Australia have been fully vaccinated?::Australia is making AZ in Melbourne.::They stopped doses only.::Half the number of doses that we were told would be given by the end of March. That's not a reason to celebrate. It's a reason to review what you are doing wrong and fix it!::The US vaccinated m in days. You still havent vaccinated those in aged care or front line workers. The local cricket club would have done a better job at organising the vaccine roll out!::And America is doing million a day.

GPs, States etc. theyre in the hands of those administering.::For what it's worth, the psychology of motivation is critical here. Promising doses per week put pressure on all parts of the supply chain to ramp up. Understanding machinations of big business and bureaucracy, I'm not sure we'd be nearly as close with a smaller target.::Kylie I hate to say it but there is not one single drug, medication or vaccine which is % safe. Women taking the pill are significantly more likely to develop a blood clot, however that's not newsworthy for some reason.::Oh ditto. Their public health response has been an epic disaster.

Have they been distributed or not? Are they here or not?::So that's still million doses that haven't been utilised right now?::It was blocked from Italy. CSLs st batch of was approved nd of March. Based on recent stats theres doses in country, half of which are set aside for nd doses.

We have numerous aged care centres in Central Vic that dont even have a date for their vax, yet we can prioritise athletes! m is less than % of the population, its a serious lag indicator.::Probably half the Pfizer total::Still million behind where you said we would be by the end of March.

Conflating 'didn't disapprove a request that was pointless' with ' didn't block export' is pretty special.::Out of million doses? Probably not worth spending much time worrying about.....::Australia didn't order million doses.::Ok - semantics - they didnt approve delivery of our Million doses.We now agree.::Im really hoping that number doesnt grow. Sick of feeling like a Guinea pig::Thats what I thought until I did some digging and found that the uk reported case from a second shot .::All the evidence around clotting suggests that the risk is in the first shot and you'd be very safe to get the second if you had no ill effects from the first::""the EU stopped delivery of Million.""Wrong.::Ifyou're not approving, it's the sameas effectively you're blocking. EU have made absolutely clear in both their public &amp; private statements that no further doses of AstraZeneca will be flowing until they've met their own orders domestically, so this is the problem we have::Please answer my question... regarding second dose of astra Zeneca and the risk of clots with that..

Thank you ALL from the bottom of my heart.::After being fine all day today, with no symptoms other than some mild fatigue, I think that about covers it! Overall experience with Shot was just as the literature suggested: Pain for a day, aches for a day, and fatigue for two days. And that's it!::For now, at V2+40 hours, I feel like a new man. Bit weak from yesterday's achiness and malaise but otherwise all is well. All vitals are back to normal and those obnoxious flu-like symptoms are long gone!::Female peer mentioned swollen glands, none of the rest of us had them. But it did sort of feel like one in the left armpit, near the injection site. To me that seemed more muscular. Either way, that pain completely disappeared by V2+40 hours.::One of my peers described it as feeling ""like being hit by a truck."" Another said ""it feels like being hung over."" She's a lot more exciting than I am.::Lots of exhaustion from V2+9 hours all the way through V2+33 hours. Almost exactly hours of achiness and fatigue and then, as suddenly as it had started, it was gone.::V2+14 hours brought the headache, which felt at first like sinuses but then went around the crown of the skull. This began to fade around V2+20 hours. Still no fever or chills or nausea to speak of. Left arm MUCH less sore than round !::At V2+9 hours, the aches began. Mild, persistent aching throughout the body. Made it uncomfortable so sleep was diminished, but was never untenable. Pulse went from s to s but no fever to note. Felt like getting the flu, minus the flu part.::V2+6 hours and my left arm feels slightly stiff, but nowhere near as painful as last time. No other symptoms at all.::This made sense when I got to the head of the line. I was polled on any reactions, side effects, or evil spirits that bedeviled me after the st shot. They noted it all down, and the needle went into the exact same spot. No pain!::So the line today was longer, which is good! Many people happily waiting their turn. We were divided i to st shot and nd shot lines, the former moved much faster than the latter.::Time to reconvene for round ! Time for the second and final shot. Let's hope this goes well!::V+71 hours, nothing to report! It is as though nothing ever happened. None of my peers reported the same tachycardia I experienced, so that seems to be a ""me"" issue. Will monitor another hours, but this might be it for this round. Awesome!::At V+53 hours all is well, so hopefully that holds through the night. No fever, no arm pain even at the injection site, no symptoms other than fatigue from last night's poor sleep. Come on, antibodies!::Either way, I'm alive and feeling good now! This has been the only really unpleasant issue with the and from what I'm hearing, not many of us have had this. I wouldn't let this dissuade you or anyone you know.::One tantalizing clue: The pulse and left arm pain were directly and inversely proportionate. As the arm pain faded, the pulse went up. I now have zero arm pain, but pulse (while off its high) is still slightly elevated at versus the normal .::Throughout last night tachycardia was an issue. It seemed too late to be anything anyphlactic so my guess (backed up by the awesome Dr. !) is that this was the immune response going into high gear: I have a history of this right before I get sick.::Here is where things get weird. At V+33 hours I sat down to relax. Pulse felt high. I checked and it was . Checked my tracker and it had been in the 's for a few hours prior though I'd been busy and hadn't noticed.::Oh Im sorry. Did I punch too hard?::You are the kindest sister.::::You certainly can, though hopefully not too hard.::So what ur saying is that I can punch U now::Around V+30 hours I seems to have more motion in the left arm. The soreness decreased and there was less pain on contact at the injection site.::V+26 hours brought a very faint, very mild achiness in lower back and knees. I imagine this is what Doc was talking about, but I'm not sure I'd even have noticed if I wasn't looking specifically for it. Temperature and all vitals remain perfectly normal!::Well, you know you've got a lot going on so I certainly wouldn't hold it against ya!::No, no, I was merely pining away for one back when mine was falling apart::Doing great! I've actually always had one, go figure.::At V+20 hours: Doc had told me to expect ""chills, aches, possibly nausea"" at this point. I have none of that. Arm feels bruised if I touch it, feels muscularly sore if I move it...and that's it! One of my peers seems to have it worse &amp; is using ibuprofen, I havent needed it yet.::Arm pain is unusual because ice packs seem to do nothing, while warm packs/cloths definitely help. Seems counterintuitive but try heat first.::Slept between V+8 hours and V+14 hours and had no major issues. Noticed pain x in left shoulder and upper arm while sleeping on that side, rolling over resolved it. Arm pain was moderate, it was heavy, stiff, and moderately painful to move immediately after waking.::To answer two questions posed: . Yes, temperature has been consistently normal throughout. No fever.2. No, I've not had any tachycardia at any point. Pulse has remained normal with the exception of when I was signing the pre-shot waiver.::V+7 hours, left arm feels heavy and sore, but is manageable. Warm washcloth helps. I can move it in all directions, it is just sore when I do so. Feels more like a bruise now. No other symptoms at all!::Sometime after V+4 hours, left arm felt sore when I moved it to lift something. Not a bruised feeling or like I was punched, but like I spent too much time in the gym on Arm Day. (And when has that ever been the case?!)::Are your sign-ups being managed by the state or the county? It might be time for you to pre-register already!::That's good! I think I'm a Phase B critical worker (in-person teacher), so it's possible I might be able to get vaccinated somewhere at the halfway point of the rollout, whenever that ends up being.::Group A is still being worked through, but they told me today that B/essential employees are about to be scheduled. Definitely a good sign!::Yes, thank you! It's encouraging to know that they have a system in place. Here in PA we're still only vaccinating healthcare workers.::Hope I answered this for you, my friend. They put my information into an electronic records system to track my appointments. Also encouraged me to use an app the CDC is using to monitor side effects, etc.::At V+2 hours, I felt a very vague heaviness in the left shoulder, only while moving it. No pain, dizziness, tingling, fatigue, or any other symptoms at all.::I'd heard reports of post-shot tachycardia and numbness/swelling. None of this happened to me. Pulse was on arrival, when I filled out the ""this might kill you but probably won't form, and back to at the time of injection. O2 sats were never below , fully masked.::At this point they scheduled me for the nd shot, which will be in exactly days. They warned me not to cancel or modify that because the timing needs to be precise. I told them I wouldn't do so for all the salsa in Phoenix.::Arriving at the monitoring site i was met by a nurse and two student nurses from a community college miles away. They chatted me up while explaining what to expect over next few days (aches, pains, perhaps nausea). They were WONDERFUL young ladies. The future is bright, folks.::About this time, some seconds post-shot, I felt a faint, mild tingling in my left forearm and fingers. It went away as I drove to the post-shot monitoring area. I was vaguely aware that my left shoulder felt ""heavy"" as I turned the steering wheel. But there was no pain at all.::As soon as this was done, the doc placed a post-it note on my car with a time on it. That time was minutes from the injection. He explained I'd need to be monitored that long and directed me to a queue of cars to wait out that duration.::""Let's see that deltoid!"" The needle was an inch long but small-gauge. I looked away for a second and when I turned back the doc was withdrawing the needle. I hadn't felt a thing! (I DID feel the seasonal flu shot months ago.) It was very quick.::Congratulations! How do they go about making sure you can get the second vaccine, or that you know when and where to get it?::Cars are directed into a covered area overflowing with doctors. Without delving into operational details, I could see how the vaccine was stored and brought over to individual injection points. A doc approached and said what to expect and what to watch out for.::I am very impressed by how smooth everything went. It is a well-oiled machine. Cars lined up into multiple queues with med staff beside them. First comes check-in, then med questionnaire, then release of liability, and then ""the room.""::Super eager to hear nothing::My left arm is full of hope.::For now, I am headed to the vaccination site, which is a drive-up location in a massive parking lot. Updates will follow.::Thank you SO much! I'll let you know how it goes in the days ahead!

Nobody will force you to take one (yet) and I doubt they ever will. How society changes to cope with new and emerging diseases who knows.::Again, private companies. The point is nobody is forcing you to take it. I agree it may reach a point where if you want to do things you'll need to take it, but nobody will force you to take it. I know what you're saying, but it will still be a personal choice.::Speak to Dolores Cahill, she is looking into the travel aspect.::Is anybody forcing you to take one? If a Country or airline doesn't let you cross their borders or use their service that's up to them. You want to fly or go abroad then YOU will make a decision if you get a vaccine or not. Nobody is forcing you to get one...::Private airlines will decide whether they will allow passengers without a vaccine to fly and countries with their own rules will decide whether they will let people in without one even if the UK Government doesn't make it mandatory.

No real detail though.::When you going to get it, viruses happen &amp; it can never be stopped we have had them for decades along with these symptoms, we have had them every year its normal. Stop acting like God &amp; thinking deaths will stop. That's the circle of life we can't stop death unfortunately.::Whats in the vaccine thats going to poison you?::I have just spoken to someone I know and he is buying car insurance as he wants to drive his car. I asked him if he would have it if he didn't want to drive a car and he said no. This is not about driving a car - its about blackmail and coercion. Abhorrent.::::the question surely is this, is David Kurten the best politician we have got? Name any other, even Mr. Walker, that recognises these so called vaccines are experimental and cohersion contravenes the Nuremberg code.::Good find (the UK is a member of the Council of Europe).::I had a horrible dream last night that my daughter was dying and I couldn't get to her due to a vaccine passport and the violation of my human rights. For people for whom this could be reality etc you will be answerable to God.::... seen enough?::The sick bastards need to go. Coming after our kids next.::*Freedom should be restored immediately.::It starts with controlling travel, it expands to controlling your EVERY movement, look at how it works across Asia, getting your ""freedom"" to travel means controlled access to airports and flights for those that comply, it could not be further away from the meaning of freedom.::""And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

And how good would be for me?Stay close in your home, or better, your room, and don't bother people willing to live free.::The vaxed can still catch it. So why the need for passports. A passport to say your symptoms will be lessened and you will have to pay for that passport more fool you.::Every country have the right to prevent you from entering but they have no right to prevent you from leaving.When they do, they are just communist masquerading.::I have had and always will have the right to go where I like, without coersion, manipulation and people like you insinuating infecting people. The vexed can still spread it::Yes::They will::Yep, my moon trip has been cancelled times so far.::Then have a vaccine::So until now you could leave the planet. ?::Every country has the right to impose its own entry restrictions. As such ""pass freely without hindrance"" is irrelevant. Quite right to impose restrictions to avoid the spread of the virus.::Because nobody would vote for him ?::Despite the vaccines being rushed out, the govt will no doubt try to claim it's not an ""experiment"", so exempt from Nuremberg.::You dont have to have the vaccine dear. It just means you cant go where you want infecting people::Read that back dear. Because of the strict controls the virus is now manageable. This doesnt mean unvaccinated arseholes can now go round infecting people::What if other countries wont allow us in without proof of vaccine ? If I have to have a vaccine to travel freely then its a price worth paying. Difficult to believe we have come to this though::I have just spoken to someone I know and he is getting health insurance, as he wants to go on holiday. I asked him if he would get it if he didn't want to travel abroad, and he said no. This is not about health - it's about blackmail and coercion. Abhorrent.::I have just spoken to someone I know and he is getting a passport, as he wants to go on holiday. I asked him if he would get it if he didn't want to travel abroad, and he said no. This is not about ID - it's about blackmail and coercion. Abhorrent.::Coercion already in force with requirement of covid free test results before (citizen or not) entering UK. Need to fight this. PCR testing is not fit for purpose.::So wrong. When is enough enough?::Suppose you have family abroad? ""Don't go abroad"" is not the answer!::I hear you &amp; hope you can stay strong. It is an attack on us mentally and not about saving our health at all as this has been designed to break us down. Our nervous system is under attack &amp; this is what they wanted. Its cruelty &amp; mental torture. Never forgive them.::If they try to proceed with this, we must fight back. Freedom of travel and the right not to be coerced to partake in medical experiments are enshrined in human rights legislation, which the UK is signed up to. I am not going to be forced to be a Kill Gates guinea pig.::They are turning the planet into a giant prison.::What Planet are you on.::Dont be so pathetic.::I will be voting for you in May::::Its so very worrying. But the majority our acquiescing, my family are saying..well if I have to have the vaccine to travel, I suppose Ill have to have it people have lost any will of right and wrong now.::Please keep up the great work David.::They will start with travel, then no hospital visits, food shopping, no deliveries, no education and any other Liberty they can take away; all done under the guise of health passports or else.

I wouldn't want to have the vaccine because of Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), where you can over react to it...?!::Exactly! Why isn't anyone investigating these deaths?

I can see this being an I.T nightmare to implement::It's also been a week of more threats, passports, vaccinating pets &amp; our children &amp; more coersion it's all due to low uptake of the vax.

No. Gene therapy is when genes are changed. mRNA vaccines do not do that.::Because it is technically a gene therapy.::::Please explain why you call it a gene therapy. Thanks.",1

antivax_1317,All vacced up &amp; no place to go. 24 hrs since I received the Astra Zeneca vaccine üíâfor COVID-19. Pleased &amp; thankful‚Ä¶ https://t.co/yGPa7YgnIL,"I'm envious!Going by BC's statements last week, front line workers will start getting vaccinated in April, after everyone +. When that concludes in June, I think they plan to open it up to the rest of the population.So it'll probably be this year at least.::I cant wait to get mine! Looks like it will be sometime in June!::We can hardly wait to get ours!::Yeah!! Excellent - good for you.::Yes. True.::Im hearing so much deliberate misinformation about roll out from people that know better. I have no words at this time. It is so bad.::Good to know. I trust I have a strong immune system. Haven't been sick with so much as a cold since the fall of when my boy came home from school sick with H1N1. I caught it from him. Knocked me down for whole days. I've never had a flu shot, but I am going to start now.::Well aware. Nothing has changed in my daily routine since the pandemic began &amp; nothing will for quite some time, I'm sure.::Actually, in this case, you want ""side effects.""They're proof of your immune system kicking in.::Janet, Might I suggest you wait two weeks for your body to build the antibodies against the AZ vaccine and hence against the Covid before venturing out? Please? Thank you.::Im happy youve recd it Janet! Good for you!::We did not get symptoms til nd day. Am thrilled and relieved to have it.::My daughter in BC received the Covishield first shot yesterday &amp; had typical flu vaccine side effects last night quite bad, but is feeling better today. So glad she was able to get it!::Yay! I found the isolation of staying home during covid not a big deal. I had nowhere or $$ to go, anywhere. I do enjoy my walks, and looking for quality food bargains! My outings in general. Perhaps in , a free senior class at a university!::I dont mind needles. Im so happy that the available bookings are full and Nova Scotians are getting it done!::I went into my local pharmacy this morning to make an appointment and there had just been a cancellation so got mine then and there! I wasnt caring what vaccine I got. If felt such a relief to get one.::I think you're right. My daughter has had her second dose of Pfizer and had some mild side effects after her second dose. My doctor said it was the same for him. I'll take that over Covid any day.::Totally agree. Got mine yesterday. No problem.::Same here. Got it last Wednesday, no side effects to report. I'm grateful to get any vaccine and I'm still hunkered down for now.::Yes, the data looks great!::I was a bit apprehensive of AZ at first, but I'm glad now that I bit the bullet. It's sounding better all the time.::Exactly! I was fortunate to be vaccinated on Saturday with AstraZeneca and am feeling fine. Everyone should take the first one offered.::Perhaps. But this was my first dosage and I was advised by the nurse of a long list of possible side effects and vaccine related symptoms, most of them similar to the side effects of the typical flu vaccine. Was also given a handout listing the possible side effects.::I think it is the second dose that the side effects happen...::Piece of cake. I hate needles and have fainted in the past, but I'm okay as long as I don't see the needle. The nurse who vaccinated me was so awesome. Very quick and painless process.::I get my first AZ shot today.",0

Youre saying now that over a million people in the UK now have long term side effects?? You havent managed to provide any evidence on any other thread, but have a go here.....::Time will tell. The fact remains that the majority of severe cases of Covid are in the senior age group. % of people get over it, most with mild symptoms. We need to protect the vulnerable and everyone else should manage their own risk, including choosing to get the vaccine.::You don't know what the long term effects are. No one does.::Ivermectin!::::::::::::It's going to take time before we know the kong term effects. No one should be criticized for questioning their safety.::You can count however you want.

That all the governments in the world and most of the scientists, conspired to contrive a pandemic, so that they could implement George Monbiots plan to save the climate? Great theory youve got there!::By you amongst others, you've literally just sent me the document that says so. The same vaccine should be used. Only in exceptional cases where the first product is unknown or unavailable should an alternative be used where the patient is at immediate high risk. Did you read it?::more sunshine... vitamin d...but keep in mind...no mass testing so no one really knows...pretty sure its already everywhere worldwide::Debunked by whom? Breitbart? ConservativeHome?Read the guidance, it's what it actually says.::Oh no! I got to the A&amp;E before breathing problems, but had the steroids. I'm hoping people can decline vaccine with no restrictions, but seems like we will have discrimination.::I've had severe reaction to penicillin, ended up in hospital, definitely won't be taking it!::Are you advocating that smokers are left to die in agonising pain from cancers? And drinkers who have cirrhosis of the liver?Would you prevent them from being administered morphine so they die in agony, to teach them a lesson too?::You realise that far left theorists like George Monbiot, loved by many on SAGE like communist party member Susan Michie, have been calling for planned recessions to 'combat inevitable environmental calamity' since at least . A lockdown is a planned recession.::so... you're more likely to have fatigue, difficulty breathing, etc, even though they are symptoms and by definition asymptomatic means you have no symptoms? Ok mate, we'll leave it there. Take care::to more effectively treat it, so stats look even better now than before. Sorry, but you're clueless::you're right, we've learned more. We've learned that dexamethasone lowers mortality even further. We've learned that vitamin D players a massive role in outcomes. We've learned patients should lie on their fronts, not backs, as that also affects outcomes, etc. We've learned how::get no symptoms, how can in get long covid? Furthermore we're told that currently in people in London have covid. That would mean, right now, over people in London have long covid, and that discounts all those that have had it already. Don't be silly ffs::if you think that in people that contract covid, get ""long covid"" you're living in cloud cuckoo land. For a start the same clowns that give you that information tell you that %+ of people that get covid are asymptomatic, which immediately destroys that narrative. If in::Please stop, you're humiliating yourself. That's an internationally recognised medical journal. The NCBI is ""The National Center for Biotechnology Information""::nothing is incorrect and I've posted you the sources to see. That's the work of John Ioannidis, the world's premier epidemiologist &amp; Stanford uni professor. As for ""long covid"", the medical term for this is ""post-viral syndrome"" and it's nothing new, it is also caused by the flu::so leave it out with the propaganda and learn about actual threats::This means that statistically, covid does not affect life expectancy. % of those that do die are either extremely moribund or terminally ill.

Only side effects for % is very low already!!! Most healthy people will not get side effect except the allergic to medicine people. You might get less side effect from vaccine than drugs.::You are clearly a knob.::playing?::Do you feel the same about unprotected sex and HIV?::Again, what on Earth leads you to believe that I have no doubts?Do you believe that about me just because I dont buy in to anti-vaxxer and other conspiracy theories? Or are you just saying it to try to discredit me? Or some other reason?Practically everyone has doubts.::Where dyou think I said Im not at all suspicious?All I did was give what I consider the best reason for administering a vaccine.I find the rapid development of vaccines more impressive than odd.Am I right in thinking youre untrained in epidemiology or public health?::No. So why weren't you?::My thoughts on the best reason I can think they are asking us to take the vaccine is because itll do things like reduce deaths and make the recovery quicker.::Imbecilic and disgraceful lies.::Liar::Thank you, Arieh. It seems that ignorance is bliss for some people.::Israel has vaccinated more than a million people. Do you think we wouldn't have noticed of them with debilitating short-term effects?

This is what the heads of the NHS said in a letter to NHS Trusts, GP practices and PCNs days ago:""Each person's second dose must be from the same manufacturer as their first dose"":::% of the U.K. population is million!!! You seriously think that many people have died? The recovery rate from Covid is %. Its a mild illness in most sufferers. No one knows the rate of long Covid. Around people die of something every year in the U.K.::What the Guardian is quoting from the Green Book, an NHS guidebook. I Had a look at it and did find this. Feel free to look for yourself. Looks like in rare cases, mixing vaccines is being allowed!::Says you casually dismissing the in a million who were left permanently disabled by a vaccine they didnt need! CDC data was showing upwards of % serious side (unable live normal or work) effects so far in USA for pfizer vaxx.

It is stupidly cruel.::When asked about long term effects Pfizer stated they will be keeping a close eye for any! How does that not prove the public are just ginuea pigs::No, you can still get Sars-CoV-2, the virus... Covid is the disease...i.e. the symptoms. The vaccine stops you having the symptoms, like all vaccines.That's how all vaccines work. They do not stop the virus entering your system.::::David, surely you are responsible for putting accurate information out there. You seem to have jumped on the anti establishment band wagon and are posting blatant lies.::You are funny.::Will you have the same attitude to those who take the vaccine and become ill. Have a look at the poor girls who have been left disabled by the HPV vaccine and tell me we should all line up. This aggressive approach by the short sighted is sickening::It depends on your definition of ""work"". How lockdown DID work, is it reduced the r rate, preventing intensive care units being overwhelmed all at once.::The CDC still recommends that people get vaccinated though::Who is the ""they"" she's talking about?

As it should be.::::The only long-term effect of Covid vaccines is that you get Covid antibodies.::Re: ""Official IFR of COVID, meanwhile also accepted by the WHO""Why would I care about the distortions you post on your non-peer-reviewed denialist blog?::Er, the best reason they are asking us to take the vaccine is to protect us, individually &amp; as a society. Same with all the other vaccines weve ever taken.::Re: ""against a virus with IFR %""You're trying to disinform people again.::Hope your one of the in a million thats left permanently disabled from your covid vaxx ya shameful clown! You wont mind as its worth it::So if covid vaxx side effects are similar you are quite happy for potentially severe disabilities from covid vaccine? A fair number of which will be in age groups that quite frankly have absolutely no need to be vaccinated in the first place!::Yes, it's all a game being played and has been from day one. China alone proves that - most residents eat batshit for breakfast, yet they still have x less deaths, with x our population are the communist blueprint for the rest of the planet..::All i can say to the boffins &amp; men in white coats. Now's the time think about a another new vaccine, to vaccinate against our new vaccines going wrong .::The government is not advocating mixing and matching, that is the kind of nonsense I expect from the New York Times::Apparently a vaccine will produce a positive PCR result.Perhaps for months.::Look on governments own web sites if you want the proof, its all there. You just need to look!::Its an mRNA vaccine! Its never been done before. Its not even really a vaccine, it creates a protein that triggers the immune response. Research about it. If it was not correct Im sure I would have been fact checked by now!::If being allergic to penicillin is reason to reject this vaccine, what connection between the two do you see? Have you consulted your physician?::Look, all I did was question someone who said the best reason I can think they are asking us to take the vaccine is that the whole lockdown era was pointless and they are trying to find a way out. To me, that sounds like a possible reason, but not close to the best reason.::Proof?::Nor me David... The MHRA urgently seeks an Artificial Intelligence (AI) software tool to process the expected high volume of Covid-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs) and ensure that no details from the ADRs reaction text are missed.::You couldnt make it up could you!!::Well dont expect to be treated if you become ill with it.::You are an idiot spreading misinformation and you are dangerous.::Youre very fortunate you live in a country where its a choice. Left up to me, Id get everyone vaccinated first and then get our wonderful heroes in the NHS to stick the jab in your left butt-cheek.

There is no mixing::Damn right I do paid my dues like everyone else::Look who has suggested multiple vaccines.::What vaccines are not man made?::Last time I looked, the 'British Isles' didn't exist.::Government totally clueless but have convinced thousands to voluntarily take part in their experiment &amp; get vaccinated to see if it works or not. They now want to experiment further on the gullible fools by mixing different types of vaccines to see what adverse effects occur.::They are not vaccines. After vaccination, you can still get COVID and pass it on. You will still be expected to wear a mask and socially distance. The only reported benefit is that it reduces severe symptoms, so may be beneficial for at risk groups.::UK government not mixing and matching vaccines!

Its out of control. Please look at the entire thread. in::Nobody has to take the vaccine in the UK. You might find there's certain things you can't do if you refuse but that's the choice to make. Being allergic to Penicillin isn't necessarily relevant but they are advising anyone that has suffered severe allergic reaction to wait.::Im sorry who are you?::When u actually find the data on the official page, which isnt easy at all. U will see that over thousand people will have had serious healthy impact events since taking the vaccine. Impressive or what..!!!::Hang on, I thought you were a lion the other day. Scared of a little needle?::Can anyone translate please?::The mix and match allegation is completely false::I was referring to the mix and match part...::Just wondering how far your beliefs stretch.::Well said David. What's happening is the result of mass brainwashing.::Good. More for the rest of us then.::How can you say this Tereasa? We knew it was going this way! The zub zero fax avail to morons.

It's quite obvious.::So you are certain they didn't sign non disclosure agreements then?::And again, millions and millions of have taken the vaccines after a year research that didn't start from scratch since SARS is very similar. The swine flu took less than months, the bird flu as well. So rushing it isn't even the case.::To be fair the CDC are reporting that they have no trial results, so I don't see how you can accuse them of lying. I make no allegation that vaccines will ""kill us"" and have only mentioned that Bill Gates funded the interrim analysis published in the Lancet. What do you mean?::You directed me to a gov website that acknowledges phase trials but that has the results found empty, as if that means no results were found. I'm saying that if we were being BSed, at least a handful of scientists working on the vaccine would've come out with it.::Actually mate it's you who doesn't have any evidence. I have directed you to the evidence and you simply refuse to accept it. Who said thousands of scientists are lying to us? Where are these statements from thousands of scientists?::You need a credible end game for anyone to believe they are lying to us about the vaccines.::What's the purpose then? Sell vaccines that kills us all? Go bankrupt and destroy the CDCs reputation for ever? Bill gates wants to control us?::And why would thousands of scientists just remain in silence about it? The people conducting the trials? The fact that you're looking for updates on a .gov website? that you have no evidence at all and just a ""lack of"" posted results in one website.::That ""website"" is the CDC record of where the trials were registered......To claim there are clinical trial results. Even though there aren't. To encourage people to believe the vaccines have been trialed and have proven safety and efficacy profiles. Which they don't.::Just because there are no posted results in that website means they're lying to us? Alright, with what objective?::Nope, that's an article claiming there are peer reviewed trial results. Now go an look at the posted trial results for NCT04324606, NCT04400838, and NCT04444674. You will note that there aren't any because, as I have tried to point out, there are no completed clinical trials.::::I am saying there are no completed phase trials for any of the vaccines that have been ""authorised."" However, you say there are and phase trials have been completed. So if you can direct me to the completed trial results I'll take a look. Please do.::With no real harm, auto correct to Portuguese::Pfizer and novavax have completed their phase of the trials, the required phase for the vaccine to be approved. Millions of people worldwide have taken it with no realizaram besides the expected effects so what are you trying to say here?::There are no completed trials, There are interim reports of ongoing trials. There are no peer reviewed completed trials. In fact they are years away from completing trials.::On the same page but i didn't purposely press the ""no results posted"" tab.::Good try, there are no results posted but there were trials still.::What trials?::Stopped at Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, all that's missing from the article is George Soros.Guess this is one of your conspiracy takes. Wrong information in the article about thenoxford vaccine whose trials were peer reviewed.::::How weird. Just logged on after someone dropped a comment on my site asking me about this. No I hadn't.

It was created in a lab financed by an international consortium of power. They started testing the vaccines with the very interesting spike protein within weeks of its ""discovery."" It's all just coincidence, of course.::So, we must prove a negative because you choose to believe that a coordinated effort to propagandize the world using a lab virus, after billions of dollars have been spent to do just that, is too improbable in your mind?::. If you want lockdowns, mask orders, and compulsory injections for ""this one"", then you're tacitly implying that you're more special than flu sufferers, since you probably never wanted those draconian policies on behalf of them.(The fear-numbers for covid are unscientific).::. I don't. And it doesn't matter. Respiratory illness is a thing, has always been a thing, and always will be a thing. There is nothing more special about ""this one"", whatever ""this one"" is.

You seem to imply we should accept bad science because of your anecdote. That's not science. Neither is your dismissive sign off.::Nice try and never said that.But the cases I saw, where people with respiratory problems, caused by a very specific virus and I was one of them.I do not know what RealEarth you are representing, but it is not the one I am living in.

Every one of which is deeply compromised in the exact same pharma Gates network that compromises the CDC. Get a clue. When one of you gives actual data, I might respond to it.::She hasnt gotten a definitive answer on this, but one theory is that because the vaccines contain polypropylene glycol (the main ingredient for n anti-freeze), people who are allergic to this are having an anaphylactic shock response.::So when Mike says ""No need to trust the CDC, look at the data from various groups around the world that have also tested the efficacy/safety of this vaccine, and make an informed decision for yourself"" How is that not thinking for himself?::That's the conventional wisdom. But he claims it's wrong under the current circumstances, i.e., a rapidly mutating, asymptomatically transmitted virus. The consequences are dire if he's right. The likelihood of that risk cannot be known. That's the point.::You seem to have missed my point about Geert Vanden Bossche's warning about mass vaccination potentially creating vaccine resistant variants, and other unknown risks. Please watch the videos posted above and in this thread:::Vaccine hesitancy cannot be solved if legitimate objections are ignored. We need an open discussion about risk.::But what if that's not actually true?::You're the reactionary. You don't have any credible evidence to oppose the vaccine other than a reactionary fear of ""big pharma"".::What about the vaccine triggered the allergic reaction?::Yes, lol yes she is.::Im sorry but youre an idiot::And its not like our country doesnt have a history of experimentation on citizens. And one of the main providers is known for paying off officials to approve their poison.::No, in fact there are no limits to thinking for oneself. What you cite is the collection of data, not critical thought.::I FKN LUH YOU GURL::Surely thinking for yourself has its limits right... Can you conduct a clinical trial yourself to test vaccine safety and efficacy? I'd say Mike is doing a great job with critical thinking but you parroting ""big pharma"" talking points while adding nothing of substance? nah.::Ever thought of thinking for yourself? Keep trusting.::Not refuted at all.The way to look at it is to look to governments and institutions you trust that have studied and accepted the results.For me that's usually the UK NHS and the government of NZ.If you trust no competent authority at all say hi to the dodo when you see him.::Ewe need to calm down and go for a hair cut, babe.Don't believe those lies that he that shears us also leads us to slaughter.

Can you post where info came from that's checkable for my friends that are sheep and took the vaccine so they could go on holiday. I thought they were smarter than that.::If people die after vaccination it is because they are old, have comorbidity and died with covid, not from covid. But before vaccination or non-vaccinated die from covid even if they have comorbidity and are old. That is very wrong, don't you think? What does this mean?::Ah, if that's how it works: what about all the people who died -with- covid before vaccination started? And the non-vaccinated who died? Many probably had comorbidity and died with covid, not from covid. How many years of life are we winning, and how many were lost with measures::The UK vaccine rollout has been done in bands, starting with +, then +. etc. This means pretty much everyone be doubled vaxxed is + or has underlying health issues. Also we don't distinguish died from vs died *with"" covid in the death stats.::Agreed. A blunt comparison of stats like Miranda is trying to do is ridiculous!::Mate the data is on a moving target, the vax % goes up from a very low base and the unvax % goes down from a very high base. The calculation needs to take the changing situation into account and use more up to date information.::I have no issue with you questioning differences.But that tweet is wrong. It compares vaccinated with unvaccinated group directly. You can't do this unless you're trying to say there's no difference between chance of getting Covid between groups. My point all along.::Oh, so do don't have any idea why there's a difference. And there was me thinking you were suggesting ""immunopathology"" with zero evidence. Oh yea, I know why it was because of the::Oh look, another question mark. There is even a 'why' in there...::out the questionmark! &gt;?&lt; 'The main purpose of a question mark, perhaps unsurprisingly, is to indicate that a sentence is a question.' See, not a conclusion duh.::Conclusion? Again: you must have mist my &gt;&gt;question&lt;&lt; mark. What do you not understand from the use of a question mark? It is not a &gt;&gt;conclusion&lt;&lt;mark. But all previous attempts of developing a coronavirus vaccine ended in immunopathology.::Quite a conclusion to jump to with zero evidence....!::Uhm, I think you missed the questionmark at the end of my tweet....::I'm not saying we shouldn't check the reasons why there is this discrepancy.But, especially seeing you haven't even given a plausible explanation of why the relationship could be causal, it's not appropriate to stop fitting brakes to bikes....I mean vaccinating people.::Why there's an increased incidence of fatal collisions among braked cyclists isn't known. Could be a causal link (e.g. brakes induce a wobble) or not; e.g - something about those that fit brakes to their bikes makes them more at risk of fatal collisions in the first place.::You have the option to fit brakes to your otherwise unbraked bicycle. Doing so will reduce your chances of collision by, say, x.However, of those who do have collisions, those with brakes have slightly more fatal collisions. Say, x.Do you fit brakes to your bicycle?::Vaccines are not in trial phase. Trials are complete.Mortality rate among the vaccinated is not %. That is just wrong.According to the data we are discussing, ~10% of cases were in the vaccinated. OF THAT %, a higher proportion (~1.7x) died when compared to unvaccinated.::Sorry but, quacking ducks have no place in science. They should look into this and rule out serious problems because the vaccines are still in trial phase! Mortality rate % should be looked into. Not only flaunt the %. Cherry picking.::Agreed. But have you seen any data to suggest this might be the case, or indeed anything to suggest comorbidities, or some other non-causal relationship, are NOT the explanation?If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck....::I thought about that too. But what happens when variants emerge to which the vaccine S-atb are not sufficient/robust enough? It's very important to check high morbidity to rule out things like immunopathology or ADE. First guess is comorbidity, but guessing is not good enough.::Don't forget your first tweet. A slightly higher mortality rate in those who have been double Vax is insignificant compared to the MUCH lower risk of catching once vaccinated. Stats support the conclusion it's much safer to be vaccinated than not.::Well your certainly not wrong bc they can.

Older with comorbidities who are susceptible?::Is this age normalized? If yes, then maybe: if your system was not good enough to react to the vaccine and give you some imunity, it will also not work well vs the virus too.::Also what is happening in Taiwan?

Spike paralell about weeks after vaccination ramped up.::The x vaccinated group also had a slightly higher mortality rate. Non-vacc much higher infection, but lower mortality and less hospitalized. So it prefents infection but when they do get infected they appear more vulnerable?::x vax also a slightly higher mortality. Age groups: I am not sure. Any age group in the UK can get vaccinated at this moment? Almost % of the population is fully vaccinated. Not only the vulnerable. Why haven't they checked/metioned the agegroups?

That doesnt say the virus has not been isolated though does it.::You just need to click on the part that says numerous reports of the virus being isolated for my information. It goes on to tell you where and by who etc. Sorry what are they admitting in this, easily doctored picture from unknown source? I dont see what youre getting at.::. Another example::You might also wish to reflect on the fact that the Moderna vaccine was developed days after they received the (computer-generated) genetic sequence from China.And to think weve been trying to get a vaccine for coronaviruses for years without success.::The question is this.

They can make the sick sicker &amp; the healthy permanently sick.::::Yes and forgive me if I dont agree with the numerous reports of the virus being isolated as claimed by your amazing source but no credible citation of the same. Ill stick to what the MHRA UK admit.::A LOT of funding went into the vaccine and thanks to worldwide collaboration we managed to get this vaccine quickly. Also they didnt start from scratch.

Immune system till /7 years old until then they catch and fall ill with every virus none to man::Again the question aint idiotic, the only thing idiotic would be taking a vaccine that has been made in under a year without having any questions on said vaccine.::::+ years to produce an apparent safe vaccine, this one made in under a year which skipped animal trials, No long term testing so no knowledge of how this substance would react in the body long term, whats the point in vaccine if you can still catch and spread the virus.::follow Christine Massey for more info.::Youre assuming its rushed, dangerous and experimental - can you back this up with credible sources? Also its only just being rolled out so of course we still follow restrictions for now. Your question is idiotic.::Happy to be a lab rat for fake science? Yeah I get it, NOT::I assume , such people feel safe because they followed every rule, suggestion and Pavlovian cue that BIG Brother gave them::How is it not straight forward? Its very simple to understand, how do you feel taking a rushed experimental substance for a virus with a ridiculously high survival rate yet you still have to follow restrictions, see simple::Its not straightforward bro.

No. The stuff in the non-mRNA vaccines shouldn't be permeating inside cells at all.And you know a tweet is not in any universe valid evidence of anything - especially this.So again I'll say 'no blood clots as a known result of mRNA vaccine'::""We found that contact with the SARS COV-2 spike protein ALONE was enough to change baseline gene expression...""::Here's a case. Found it in sec. Good luck to you. Spike protein is being delivered by all of them. Different delivery system - both styles of delivery get you to the same place. The gene Code for the spike gets into the cell. The lymphocytes destroys the cell. Blood clot.::No read the articles. The one that says the spike itself with no harmful virus caused illness.::'They regret taking it' Is not based on any facts. That's a made up statement. Maybe they think it was worth it on the whole. I would.Yes mandate. Not like it's gong to happen how about we get all the unhealthy vaccinated, then we see if a mandate is necessary.::Your numbers are a bit off there. I'd encourage making sure you have your stats correct before making broad claims like 'under '.And half the country doesn't fit into the 'healthy' category. So if that's your criteria - it doesn't work as a moral comparison.::It is temporary. It has been each time insofar.Trials will be ongoing for another years.is it different? Yeah. Are there concerns of very unlikely risk - apparently some.But it's a maybe vs. many thousands of definite deaths. I don't see a choice here.::This is astrozeneca though. Astrozeneca is not an mRNA vaccine.::Looks like the clotting issues are only on the non-mRNA vaccine. I don't believe they cause lymphocytes to attack body cells.::No buddy - that's not correct.The spike protein is what allows the virus to attach to a cell and infect, in order to create more virus.The spike protein itself doesn't cause covid-19. The virus taking over the cell and replicating is what causes disease.Does that make sense?::Do it looks like we're talking about two different things. The mRNA vaccines don't seem to cause clotting at all.::::In the lungs - is what the article talks about.And the baseline function they're talking about is from the virus - not the vaccine.The change in baseline function is - I believe - what kills the lung tissue.::But the whole process doesn't last more than a few weeks. So if this was a common occurrence we would already be seeing this occur in the world, and in all other mRNA vaccine trials both before and during the covid19 mRNA vaccine.(2/2)::Unlikely. Could deaths - if caused by the vaccine - have been caused in that way? It may be possible - I don't know how many spike proteins are generated - how many cells typically exhibit them, how long those spikes last, etc.(1/2)::That all sounds right, yes.::Whichever cells get the mRNA. Likely most are in the bloodstream - as that is where the mRNA is introduced and is present in first.The cells exhibit both the spike proteins and some waste products on the surface.::No one knows that they are 'more prevalent'.Sure - tests are good. But the idea that these things were never tested is likely incorrect.And headaches, dizziness, etc. - these are also all reactions to other vaccines. Side effects of some sort are to be expected.::which cells are making the spike bc each cell hangs spike-making waste product outside the cell. Docs believe the headaches dizziness and vomiting are potentially blood clotting and cell destruction and tests not done now must be done to detect clots. Much MORE prevalent.::The will shoot billions of mRNA into your muscle where they will enter the blood, then into the blood vessel cell walls. Those cell walls (endothelial cells) will begin to create the spike. The cells will push the new spike out into the blood stream. The lymphocytes can tell::It does seem that the lymphocytes will destroy the cell before long, so the spike protein making process will not go on forever. But one contains billions of mRNA. Will the person die or be harmed for life by the time the lymphocytes get around to killing all the cells w mRNA?::The spike protein will float around in the blood stream and stick to certain tissues. Not all but some. Those that it sticks to will attract lymphocytes that will kill the cells the spike sticks to. That's autoimmune disease&amp; As per article, thespike can change baseline function::Bc the spike protein did that. Yes it's on the virus. But the spike protein wherever it comes from is the cause of disease. And that's what the vaccine (maybe with good intentions) is going to make your cells create, to then float around in your blood steam and create mayhem.::It's a semi-nitpicking point - but the clotting is actually becoming -less- common - even if all those VAERS accounts are correct (which we don't know if they are - as we've discussed).The frequency in relation to the number of shots given is decreasing - so less common.::As far as I know - the mRNA is far more likely to fall apart before it gets attacked by lymphocytes. I could be wrong there.But yes - cell destruction.I believe the clotting is a result of inflammation in blood cell walls, not cell destruction - but I'll check to be sure.::Then why are you talking about the vaccine in relation to that article when it's -only- about gene expression in lung tissue - and is only addressing the virus' gene potential gene expression changes?::And the fact that the clotting is what we're seeing on the VAERS, means to me that all is not as right as the health authorities want us to believe. All of the clotting - an extremely rare event but now more and more common - make me think the docs sounding the alarm are right.::The scenario proposed by other doctors is that the body's lymphocytes indeed destroy the mRNA, but the entire cell as well, believing the whole cell is an invading foreign body. Cell destruction results in bleeding, which results in clotting. Clotting can lead to death, stroke.::Ok. If it were true, I would be very happy. Bc there is no long term data in humans, as this is entirely new for the human race, I'm not sure Reuters or anyone has the absolute authority to know at this time. But I appreciate the possibility.::I transcribed it. Of course I read it so you could read it better.::And if it is like the flu, then when have we as a nation ever accepted that we would go to our local pharmacy for a flu shot knowingly accepting that we might come down a day later with a neurological disorder. Temporary or not. Trials still ongoing. No one knows!! Factor that in::covid-19 survival rates are better than the flu for ppl under and healthy. Yet, old and young are experiencing severe side effects (and death) and were healthy before. They regret taking it. All should do their own risk/benefit analysis.

As explained by Pfizer, this approach trains the immune system to recognise and respond appropriately should it encounter the virus in the future (here).::Evidence.The mRNA that instructs cells to create the spike protein is broken down by the cell shortly after the protein is synthesised (here). The protein itself, meanwhile, is broken down when it leaves the cell and is met by the (1/2)::Oh geez. And you're a Trumper?Nevermind. You don't care about facts.::Tell me Joseph. Is any of that neurological 'damage' permanent?Is Bells Palsy permanent?No one's ignoring temporary, non-life-threatening conditions. They just don't matter when you're talking about a potentially deadly disease.::Yeah. Sigh. Yeah I have.Look back. Actually read the articles you're posting, and read my responses.You know - if you care about honesty. I'm not sure you do at this point.::You know it's not deaths in months. I've already explained at length to you why VAERS reports aren't covid vaccine deaths.And no, it's not. Did you read this article?Because you're missing the whole 'lung' aspect of it. I don't think you did.::Like... i can't prove to you what a spike protein is any more than looking up 'spike protein' on google would.But you haven't looked it up. &lthrug&gt; You just don't want to know. Hence you believe misinformation.::No. I have reason. You have faith. You haven't been able to refute any of the reasons I've given against your arguments.I'm sorry - but you've got no argument when you can't stand up the the most basic level of scrutiny.::*debunking::It's a HUGE probWhy? Bc the will cause your cells to start making the Spike Protein /7. Your lymphocytes will start to destroy the cells of your own body making the Spike Protein when they realize the foreign invader is coming from your OWN body's cells. Why in mos::You have not debunked a single thing with a single bit of evidence. Not a single scientific study. Just your own incorrect and misinformed guesses. I know I won't change you. You'll get it bc you have faith. That up to you. But don't pretend you've done any drinking.::Numerous reports of neurological damage - Bells Palsy (facial paralysis), paralysis to one side of the body, involuntary motion. Totally ignored by the MSM.::So is our discourse basically going to be you throwing non-issue after conspiracy theory after disinformation article at me, and me debunking it, you not listening and then sending the next one?::Sigh.Yes - this may be true.Since the vaccine is in the blood primarily and first, you don't need to worry about this in regards to the vaccine.Okay? This is a problem with the covid virus only.::And?If this were an issue we needed to worry about, it would already be reflected in reports of adverse effects.This inflammatory response - if it does indeed occur, would be within the first few days of inoculation - and definitely long over after a couple weeks.::::Joe. Look some of this stuff up before posting it for godsakes. This is a lie.The spike protein - as the name 'suggests' is a PROTEIN only.::::Ncbi - National Center for Biotechnology information. Mdpi Wikipedia -Multidisciplinary Publishing Institute The Spike Protein is an active pathogen, not harmless virus cell-parts used to create an antibody. Spike protein is going to make the carrier of it sick. Antidote plz!::No.You would need the mRNA to reach each cell of the body and penetrate it for this to be true.It doesn't - for multiple reasons.There's no 'in essence' about it. This woman is making things up - and this claim is wrong.::You seemed to say the injection does not go into every cell in the body. The blood stream has to contact every living cell of the body in order to keep that cell alive. So it would be logical to conclude that every cell in the body is in essence, injected with the mRNA shot.::'every cell'.Obviously it goes everywhere.::The injection goes from the muscle into the blood steam. Contrary to what some believe, it does not stay localized at the the injection site. Evidence of this? Adverse events are occurring pretty much everywhere the blood stream goes.::I think you might have misread this::Sure. If you ignore all the young lives already lost to covid.::Uh huh. Now find a thousand more. Only then will you be anywhere close breaking even to people in that age group already killed by covid.::Great. Then all the same businesses can require them - and all the businesses that don't can fail. Capitalism.::Oh look. No longer available to watch. Oh well.

Surely you have evidence.I'll skip ahead - you're not going to be able to provide evidence because that's a fact you just made up. Well done.::No, they -do- tell you that. There isn't any evasion because it's freely available information.No one is saying deaths isn't a big deal.Folks are saying: even -if- those deaths were all vaccine-caused- the is tiny compared to the who will die if we don't vaccinate.::a.) Number is off. Typo?b.) Try to understand this part, it's important:No one said they -weren't- vaccine related either. No one is claiming that.Why?

But, yes, no social distancing, lockdowns, masks, etc were necessary.::No response to the pandemic was necessary?::Oh. And no - it's not a laughing matter. I'd consider encouraging vaccination through passports a matter of many lives or many deaths.::Just because Bill Gates said everyone in the world has to be vaccinated, doesn't make it true, does it. There are actual treatments which could and should be made available. Duh.::None of this was necessary.::So true. The vaccine has become the thing that is robbing young lives, not the virus.::Is this more about health, or spite, for you at this stage?::No.They are reporting that -possible- adverse reactions where death was the result.As they clearly state - the VAERS reports of death are not to be counted as reports that people have died from the vaccine.::I'm not seeing it. You;re saying there's a contradiction on this page? Where?::Lol. That's his entire point. 'experimental vaccines should be available to all but mandatory to none'.How is that petty? It's literally the heart of his argument.And I'm as arguably right as your point is here. There's no official designation of experimental.So no.::Don't derail the conversation with your petty point making. Health passports to access most aspects of society is no laughing matter.

Billions of doses over like years administered and very safe, with very promising preliminary results for covid if taken early.::Personal liberty is idiotic? So what is your angle, then? Why are you so concerned with what everyone else is chosing or not chosing to do?::::years. years. The difference is moot when the problem is now. It's called calculated risk. Up to the individual, until it's not....but until it's not, it is. My hypothetical is no less ridiculous than yours.::Transmission is coming mostly from small gatherings at home according to the statistics and science. There's a very valid argument to be made that lockdowns force people into that exact situation, which would actually be making things worse.::Not sure what my parents were thinking, but I know that I did not follow my doctor's recommendations blindly and instead opted to space out the required vaccinations to lessen the chances of any bad outcomes. Also year studies is a silly/nonsense thing to say.::This::Unless you were homeschooled in the US, you were also given many vaccines that people didn't have year studies on. What were your parents thinking!?::Yeth!::Just joking::Dumb statements are a male trait.::::So if you take these safe supplements bc why the hell not if they might help, mask whenever and social distance to reduce exposure and potential viral load, you improve your chances of severe symptoms.::Melatonin appears to have antiviral properties. Vitamin D levels correlate to COV19 outcomes. Vit C and zinc seem to help fight viruses.::This was a solid discussion all. GG.::Mine is solely based on the + opinions Ive gathered from all the Dr and nurses ive run into.I respect others and wear my mask in stores and what not but my kids still go on playgrounds, I dont wear a mask outdoors and I see family and close friends.::Long term studies was the only hesitation I had about this vaccine, but then it came down to my original statement::Yes I've read all those things and mrna looks very promising for many things, not just covid. Still no long term studies yet tho.::Hasnt been my experience with the current surge, but then again, theres a reason theres a phrase called get a second opinion::Exhausting::There's supplements for that as well::Is it tiring knowing everything?::Your cynicism is unmatched, sir. Everyone is motivated solely by money.::You didn't answer his question::Just saying, our nurses ...... didnt care, my DRs....... didnt care. Went to my DR about months ago, he walked in, saw me fidgeting with my mask, closed the door, said I didnt have to wear the stupid thing and shook my hand. this is my personal experience.::As of a few weeks ago they were talking about the Bay being very low on the outbreak scale.::They're already talking about giving it to kids, they will push for it soon.Also mRna vaccines are a completely new class of vaccines with no long term studies done yet, though you're right about changing the proteins::Theyre not vaccinating children under the age of , so thats irrelevant. And mRNA vaccines are not new. They changed the protein in it for covid.::That does not sound accurate::lol not sure how to take this but yes, I guess I am lucky.::You're lucky to live in the Bay area, where a bunch of snowflake liberals listen to science. The Bay area is one of the lowest outbreak centers in the country relative to their population::We also tried to opt out of the covid test, worried that if my wide tested positive, we wouldnt have the baby. The nurses never had anyone decline but told us we didnt have to if we didnt want to and if my wife was positive.....lol nothing different... NOTHING this is crazy::Ofc it's not all just vitamins, just like it's not all masks and lockdowns.::.....every nurse that came in, secretly told us we didnt need to wear the mask....wtf? Sorry man, no vaccine for me or my children EVER::It absolutely can fight it off, that's literally what your immune system is there for.::This is crazy to me, I live in the Bay Area and literally no hospitals are overrun. Most doctors I have visited didnt take this serious. I had a baby weeks ago and NOTHING, literally no difference at all. Masks? Sure, for the facade......::That was when he progressed beyond early stage, I'm talking early/prophylaxis, plenty of studies and science to back that up if ur willing to put the trump stuff aside and have an open mind.::Much downside if it doesnt work against a massive viral load, especially to high risk people and those susceptible to it.If it was all vitamins and supplements this wouldnt have been an issue, but it is.::Agreed, a healthy immune system is great, but it cant fight off a massive viral load most people are gettingWe should all have healthy immune systems, for best practice covid or notThe media reports on what it wants to though, in this case::Vitamins and supplements strengthen ur immune system, this is not controversial or misinformation bro, it's science. Also perfectly safe, so it couldn't hurt. Literally downside...same is true for ivermectin.::I could treat this as a ""gotcha"" but I still think you're right. He should be doing this more. But he hasn't totally avoided it::Cause thats what Trump got? Right? no He got blood infusions with the protein antibody and experimental drugs.::It hurts if its misinformation..::k lives couldve been saved if we used hydroxy chloroquine as an early treatment/prophylaxis, but y'all still not ready to hear that::Or send megadoses of vitamin d to all high risk people and shout it from the rooftops. Why does Fauci never mention any supplements or vitamins to strengthen your immune system. Does this not seem strange to u? Can't hurt, why the silence?::Theyre going to be a lot higher when the hospitals cant treat those dying of it.Additionally, the extra spread is causing hospitalizations to skyrocket.Heres a table of hospitalization rates from Covid (left column) and flu (Right Column) by age::Yes please. Buy ETH and buy my LINK bag at the same time.::Buying eth is also a female trait fyi::Mortality rates r in line with the flu, as the WHO just admitted today::It's a crime that these people are not being given ivermectin as a prophylaxis as is done in other countries already.I suspect the reason is theres no money to be made from it.::I'll agree with you about the ineffectiveness of some of that shit because it has been pretty poorly thought out. But the virus sucks and is nothing to joke about. We should all be trying to eradicate this thing instead of call it a flu::It admittedly looks safe from what I've read, but again there's no long-term data so we really don't know yet::My mom was a nurse until about years ago, now doing a desk type job at the hospital. She gets emails every single day offering $100/hr for shifts + single day bonuses because they're that desperate for staff.::Its only locked down because no one is listening, and people are out more than ever::And yet it's one of the most locked down states in the country. Perhaps they don't work and we need to be looking outside the box more, rather than continuing to do things that clearly don't work.::That's what I'm telling you. If you read about how a new mRNA vaccine gets created, manufactured, and tested, you'd realize there's minimal riskYour idea of the risk of a vaccine comes from not understanding vaccines. Which is okay, but you're also not trying to learn more::Overblown, meanwhile hospitals in the LA area are turning away patients, running out of oxygen tanks, and turned into a casualty triage situation::Risk/benefit doesn't add up imho::This is not a very intelligent statement my dude. Take a deep breath and reread what u just wrote.::To avoid getting a virus that has negative health impacts, and also to avoid spreading that same virus to others.::The survival rate of COVID-19 may be % for young and healthy, but guess what? It's % for the vaccine. I'd like to hear what you believe the risks are of getting the vaccine. Because again, it seems to me that you and people like you have to answer except ""we don't know""..::The WHO just admitted today that covid has been overblown and has a low fatality rate Please lease tell me why would I take a vaccine that doesn't have any long term studies done on it yet, genuinely curious.::Have you read more than words about how the vaccine was manufactured, its ingredients, or the results of the trials? I doubt that you tried to find the information that you're asking Dan about. Willing to bet you've had non-descript concern based on nothing out of the gate::::We might be near the tipping point for ivermctin. Andrew Hill, who advises WHO and Gates Foundation, did a mega-analysis and says if results of more trials (due in January) follow same trends, ""this really is going to be a transformational treatment.""::Not yet::Have u looked into ivermectin at all yet?::Its a contributing effort, Im on all the supplement stacks as well, especially because of my job::Vitamin D deficiency seems highly probable::The problem with it is that no one knows why its bypassing people, my theory is blood typeBut Im not a scientistthats what makes it so unnerving::You know Trump sneaked into the lab and inserted Bleach into the vax when no one was looking.::Many people seem to have natural immunity, some speculate exposure to other newer coronaviruses (the common cold) might be the reason (which would explain why kids do better with it)::Ill let you know when it comes down to it::Genuinely curious what that threshold would be...kids have above a % survival rate with covid. What would push u over the edge to give them a barely tested vaccine?::I do all those things, but you cant protect yourself from a virus that the body has no defense for and has never experienced, everTheres no immunity to it, thats the problem::I said If it came down to it, meaning they were at risk in some way shape or form::There are many ways to protect your immune system without taking a barely studied novel vaccine sir::You have enough evidence that there's no long term issues to give it to your own kids, who are not at risk of serious harm, assuming they're healthy?::Ill put it to you like this:- do I have my concerns? Yes- am I jumping for joy to take it? NoBut it was put to me like this when I spoke my concern to a trusted anesthesiologist you wanna worry about unproven speculation or die of Covid pneumonia?I chose the latter::Honestly I'm not convinced it's safe bro, it just hasn't been studied enough, long term data. I would not want anyone in my family taking it, and I don't see a problem with making light of it.::Ive already taken it, and if it came down to it, yes::Im fired up.Im seeing the chaos going on right now with the clinics I support and my place of work and Im fired up.::Its not a joke to perpetuate this stuff over social media when healthcare systems are collapsing &amp; people are sick/sufferingI love you man, but dont be a part of the problemIt is your choice but dont go labeling it some dumb buzz phrase for the sake of entertainment::Out of curiosity, would you be comfortable giving this vaccine to your kids?::Hahahahaha::It was a joke, but also we live in a free country and I will not be taking it.Also, we have ivermectin which seems to be an effective prophalxysis. I'm pretty sure I already had it, and I take megadoses of vit d, plus quercetin, zinc and vit c::How beta of you to sayA real man takes on what hes uncomfortable with and what he doesnt want to do or agree for the benefit of his family and the greater good to keep them safeYour logic is blinded by your bias",0

antivax_2398,"I got the #CovidVaccine. I didn't need the #vaccine, but it was my civic duty to get the #vaccination and do my par‚Ä¶ https://t.co/jKfXZQgEX0","Exactly how I felt! Great sense of relief!::I got it too but for none of those reasons. I did because I (&amp;everyone) needs to.::Actually thats not true, I was in the hospital for two months with kidney issues and sepsis, my virologist, an ER doc and four nurses said I dont need the shot since I already had Covid. There are many studies out that confirms it. Natural immunity is always best.::Why didn't you need the vaccine?::I won't encourage my young daughters to get vaccinated, and will leave my adult friends and family to use their own wisdom in making their choices regarding the vaccine.::No, the politicization was driven by people that wanted to do anything they could to drive the ""monster"" out. He wasn't perfect, and added to the politicization, for sure. But, he also did good things. He certainly got the vaccine ball rolling.::Cause I'm already vaccinated.::They've done what? Researched the timeline on the old vaccines? I'm sure they have. That's why someone could find that out. I don't have time to, for now, though I'm curious. As far as telling me to get vaccinated, you're wasting your breath.::I don't know what the timeline was regarding the previous vaccines. I'd be curious to know, but I admit I want someone else to do the research on that. I've got enough on my plate.::I expect there was concern in the early days regarding those vaccines as well. But, what's different this time is that this disease and vaccine was highly politicized. My mom is and she said things are very different around this vaccine that around the previous ones.::Every person that holds back does so with good cause according to their own judgement. We may or may not agree w/their judgement. But, that's the case with everything in this world. We each weigh evidence &amp; make choices, &amp; deserve the autonomy to do so, in as much as is possible.::I believe in vaccines. I was hesitant because of the rush and politics of it. I got the vaccine in spite of the push and the insistence from so many that we HAVE to get it. I didn't HAVE to get it. I still fully support those that hold back.::It's not quite true to say that it doesn't hurt. I don't card about the card. I've had it. Two of them. The second one hurt. I'm not talking about the needle. I'm talking about the reaction. I was desperately sick for /2 days. So, yes, it most definitely can hurt.::I appreciate your understanding of honor and patriotism...Thanks.::The dying people of India thank you........::It's called a healthy immune system. Used to be pretty common::And actually there was a miss speak in my post. It was Pfizer. Not Moderna::I'm not speaking on behalf.

As to the Changi g of physiology in the brain, I either heard it on CNN or read it in the paper. I can't rember wich. So no. Not BS.::That's great. My husband and son's fiance had very little if other than soreness. Both had PhizerMy son and I had the side effects much worse. We both had Moderna::From my understanding, there are a few reasons you need the vaccine, and theyre principally for others - getting vaccinated means you dont carry/shed virus to near the degree you would otherwise,&amp; it keeps the virus from using you as a reservoir to mutate &amp; spread new variants.::Bot::Sure Jan.

Many dont.::What do you mean you didnt need the vaccine, have you got super powers against the virus ? The deadly smallpox virus was eradicated off the face of planet by mass vaccination programs. Now those born after in North America &amp; worldwide no longer get vaccinated for smallpox.::Thank you, your outlook is refreshing!!!::I get mine Tuesday.::Yes!::These other people can get the vaccine themselves. If they don't, why should I take it just to protect them?::Then those others can just get the vaccine to protect themselves. FYI...There is no proof that this vaccine prevents you from transmitting the virus to others. They don't yet know the answer to that BASIC question.::Taking an experimental vaccine that has severe side effects for many to MAYBE protect against a virus that I am at almost no risk from is NOT my civic duty.

Is he too much of a tough guy to need it?Glad he got it, but that was weird.::Youre playing into them. You are, its circle and divide (like a Q) and youre injecting a microorganism which will synthesize Nps when exposed to amplified radio waves, just like cov19 did. They wont deny it, they cant. Its not about health. Its about death and civil war.::You be patriotic your way. And Ill be, mine.::Serve to others and civic duty. Two things people need to be reminded of daily.

Were not percent sure of the consequences::All Americans need the vaccine!!!::Quite possibly the dumbest tweet I have ever seen. You didn't need the vaccine, but you got it. Meanwhile, we have raging hotspots in India and Brazil, where ppl who need the vaccine can't get it bc ppl like you need to virtue signal. Everything that's wrong with the world.::Youre an idiot::Youre absolutely right!::Isnt wonderful that you know that COVID-19 wouldnt kill you or leave you with lingering effects?::If you vax works why do you need me to get it? think about it....::If you see it as your civic duty to take an experimental mRNA vax go for it. Don't hold it against me for waiting until the long term studies are completed ( following science ). This vax is not FDA approved. All animals died a yr l8r in previous mRNA vax trials.::Excellent analogy! This further proports the GOP hypocrisy. I thought I would never be able to physically serve my country, but looking at it this way I have, and it only lasted two shots in the arm two weeks apart::Time will tell who is ignorant. Have u started to learn Chinese yet?::Leave the tribe::Kary got a good laugh::Shag off loser.

Snap out of it....and try not to die in the process!Best of luck!!::How do you know that its better than the alternative?Maybe you should ask the families of the full vaccinated people who have died after receiving the vaccine or more than with the virus after vaccinated?::This is the way to serve your country this moron says.::Matt, please tell us why you don't need the vaccine. Many folks are asking this question. And, I hate to disagree with others, but covid is only ONE of the enemies we have to face. Terrorism is another. And it's not going away in the near future. No fences can keep out the hate.::He is telling it like it is Barbara, The enemy is disinformation turning fellow citizens against each other.

Thalidomide has nothing to do with the Covid vaccine discussion.::Sounds gross doesn't it.::It was painless and it successfully relieved morning sickness. No it wasnt a vaccine.::Thalidomide was not a vaccine. It was a sedative.::I think they way we slaughter livestock is also quick and painless. By which I'm not saying we should not eat animals. We should eat them nose to tail after having lovingly nourished them through a natural, harmonious life.::the refusal to believe truth over lie. How did they know so many would willingly do that? I also think they have trialled the vax on many unwilling test subjects and know precisely what it will do and when.::And the foolish will eat it up even though it will only be the vaccinated dying.

I can't for the life of me understand::More fool those for taking what they say at face value, without looking into what theyre injecting their body with &amp; weighing up those risks against those posed by Covid, which lets be honest for the vast majority are miniscule.::This I am told and it should be explained that it is experimental::Our natural immune system is very complex &amp;interwoven. Genetically fiddling with it has the potential to render it useless in some ppl. Problem with covid is that next year theyll just blame it on a new variant &amp; not the vax when loads die.

I think a lot of ppl actually like it!::That always makes me laugh - like they think were worried about a sore arm! Its pathetic!::Are they scared of pathogenic priming I wonder?::And the fact that they didnt immediately drop down dead somehow shows we are all conspiracy theorists::I am more worried about the long term damage it might do to my immune system.

They assume that everyone is as shallow as they are - unable to think beyond the surface; pitiful, really......::It baffles me they think the resistance is pain.

Ok, I am also not keen on being ill short term - I am never ill. Why would I take something that made me ill?

And your light bulbs are not listening to you::Nope. I dont want it. It makes no sense why its being pushed when the virus has a % survival rate.I have no problem if others want to take it.

If POTUS could be kept in the dark about that, its scary.::The normal develop cycle buys time to figure out if pharmaceuticals really are safe.::*except Florida and every region that neglected to implement mitigation::This skepticism wasnt wrong, but it was totally misdirected. Nah, actually it was projection. While POTUS was kept in the dark, I dont think that she was.::No it aint. Did you know that they had this shot months before the first outbreak in the US? POTUS didnt know that. POTUS was kept in the dark, which is super scary. POTUS was also kept in the dark that there would way too conveniently be a vaxx a week after the election.::Your mother is somebody who should get it. There are a heck of a lot of younger people who shouldnt.::Thats true in areas where there are a lot of people who think that over % of people who get Covid need to be hospitalized, but the furthest thing from it in areas where a lot of people correctly think that -5% of the people who get Covid need to be:::So how come the vaxx is only on emergency use authorization?::The timing of it (literally a week or so AFTER the election) was way too politically convenient for the incoming Biden administration, as in its supposed to make him look good and get him the pre-Covid Trump economy. No thanks. I aint that dumb, especially with decades ahead.::No one cares. Do you know what is in any meds you take when you dont feel well? Stop grandstanding::Pres. Trump cut the unnecessary red tape. The vaccine wasnt rushed, the normal development cycle takes YEARS too long.::As the effectiveness of the vaccines drop. The lying tyrants yell louder for you to get it. No thanks.::COVID denier of a President of Tanzania just died, probably from COVID and Trump would have certainly been intubated if not for the very inaccessible therapeutic he received. But by all means please encourage more people to not get vaccinated, which will lead to MORE DEATHS.::You live in a fantasy world.::Wow. You are such an ignorant idiot.::Hahahhaaaa you think this is a magical virus that will not end with herd immunity ! You probably think its a naturally occurring wild virus too! Moron.::The vax, so why are you acting as if your uncles death is somehow more important than theirs? Stfu, ahole.::You shut the fu k up. You arent a doctor. You come on here and start lashing out at people that have every right to question motives of these government agencies and pharma complained and also the right to refuse to put this shit in their bodies. You know people have died from::Largest safety study in The history of medicine. CDC tried getting approval from FDA for coronavirus vaccine. FDA denied due to safety issues. EUA is only way Covid vaccine authorized, still not FDA approved!!::I have no problem with the vaccines - my year old mother has hers and she's fine. She is a non-Hodgkins survivor (had it in her sinuses of all places). I do have a problem with how there are still no definitive conclusions about behavior after and how this administration lies.::Your choice.::Well followers would suggest you're a paid bot::How did he invent racism... Please explain and give specific examples or shut the hell up::Yes it's a vaccine. Don't get it if u don't want it::And all the ferrets in mRNA tests died::Im sorry about your uncle, but being as young as he was he may of had underlying conditions he didnt know about. Who knows? And J&amp;J has never produced vaccine so I would be hesitant, especially since they gave so many women uterine and ovarian cancer with their talcum powder::It protects no one but you, and only to minimize possible hospitalization. You can still get it and certainly spread it. Why you would take this gene therapy knowing that is beyond me::Research the ferret studies they did on the mRNA vaccine. Spoiler alert, they all died::Wait until they hunt you down and force you to take the vaccine. Then you'll know the real purpose of the ""vaccine"".::Listen, mental patient, I didnt say that. Of course people died from it! Dont be stupid! But now they are spreading other viruses because thats how viruses work!::Just because they indoctrinated us well in their corporate codes, regulations, acts, edicts &amp; orders, remember stand in another jurisdiction not that of US Citizens(CORP GOV EMPLOYEES) but the land &amp; soil. All can&amp; will be held accountable in their personal capacity.::Each person has to weigh the risk but please check out Monica Gandhi MD, Vinay Prasad MD and ZdoggMD for calm reasoning about vaccine. RNA vaccines have been in development since about . DJT just got government out of the way!::So Trump was lying? Now I understand why we lost the elections. It wasnt all fraud.::Who said no one died from it? I certainly didnt. That virus is over. They are purposely spreading new ones now.::We dont need a vaccine for the virus that was around in and half of . Thats over. These new corona viruses are being labeled as variants of SARS-cov and they are not. This vaccine is useless.::It contains the protein from the virus. How is that no part of the Covid-19 virus ???::Thats ludicrous. Makes zero sense.::Are you saying you arent taking Fauxcis advice?::I wouldnt have taken it before January.::I do not take medical advice from a tv or computer. I may research and discuss with my doctors, but Im going to seek medical advice and directives from the medical community.::No straws, just going off what Johnny said.::So now its tyrants? Operation warpspeed and trump before, not. Got it::Keep grasping at straws.::There are still unknowns. If it is correct that the volume of virus is relevant to the severity of sickness, then this vaccination could make a difference for others.::So trump wasnt the head of operation warpspeed? Then someone needs to tell all those conservatives that have been saying that for months that he wasnt.::He didnt say Trump was a tyrant, its being pushed now by lying tyrants.::So on Nov is was unacceptable but Nov it was ok? Got it::I forgot that part. But now I remember seeing vid of a doc talk about that. Had something to do with lab capabilities here in US. I have no links on it, but may have to go back to research those points.::And they are denying they are dying from the vaccine. The companies, the cdc and The Who and governments will never ever admit the vaccine killed these people.::The lying tyrants are the ones who are profiting from it and who are suggesting that people be required to get it.You injected Trump into this. He helped make the vaccine available and is happy to take credit for that. He has never pushed it.::Are you for real right now? That is absolutely the truth.::Because the tv and computer tell people it helps others and people that dont get it are selfish and killing others. In other words, brainwashed.::Take that up with Johnny::Your understanding of vaccines seems limited. This page gives you an insight into the myriad different forms of vaccine. If you read it you might not sound likes so much like someone who....doesnt read this sort of thing.::Antibody dependent enhancement::Including Trump. He needs to let this shit go. Why in the world did he get that vaccine? Makes zero sense, he just got over Covid- .::Im not the one who said the vaccine was rushed and pushed by lying tyrants. But nice try.::Did you see this?::I dont need or want a vaccine to combat a virus that my bodys natural defenses provide me a better than % chance to defeat.::It should never have been political.::While the process used to create the COVID-19 vaccines is novel, its not an unfamiliar technology... In fact, scientists have been working on coronavirus vaccines for decades.::Seems that when there is a big govt push to 'do something', there is an ulterior motive. With the vaccines unproven, and the govt saying ""just get one, doesn't matter which one"", it seems that this may all be a payback to big pharma to produce a vax for a virus that was dying::Trump didnt have time to be a tyrant, he was too busy inventing racism and global warming::Agree::So its just political for you?::Because it became too much of a political weapon.::I took it because I meet with a lot of retirees and live with someone that has life threatening complications.::Trump had his admin streamline the process because that's what responsible leaders do during a pandemic.But he also said it was for those who want it. Having a vaccine available and forcing it on people who don't want it are two completely different things.Nice try, tho.::Yep yep::Same::But why wouldnt you have taken it before the election?::Because I would have considered it rushed at that time. I was waiting until after the election regardless of who won.::May be true. Im with grown kids, and Im still not taking the vaccine. (I dont want more kids, just grandkids)::Least the Trump admin made it.::You have no critical thinking skills. Get lost.::::If someone has an extreme inflammatory response from a vaccine and dies, that would be stated on a death certificate. If that is on there, the insurance company could deny payment.::You missed it again. These are EXPERIMENTAL and will be considered so for YEARS more. I have NEVER had an experimental vaccine.::That still is not completely clear. They are saying that the person having it is not a reason for denying coverage. They are not stating that if the person DIES from complications after having it, that they won't deny it. Two different things.::Ever been vaccinated? Worn perfume? Had food additives?::Not for me::Simone Gold, MD is a good source for the immune problems that can flare up with these vaccines - particularly the mRna ones.::you want them from every state insurance department?::This has happened to my sister. My nephew is requiring her to get it to see her grand baby. That is bullying. She has MS and I worry it will kill her. But she has decided to get it so she can see the baby.::Are you denying that these vaccines contain aborted baby fetal tissue? Look that one up, genius.::Prove it::Anyone who voted for a dementia patient is not qualified to give me good advice. Dems are the most incompetent screwups I have ever seen. Open borders will destroy our country. People like you have no brain power, no critical thinking skills.::Interesting. Most people I come across are terrified and cant wait to get their shot.::amen::This is absolutely and unequivocally FALSE.::What is in this shot that they want every person on the planet to take it?::There will be some litigation over these vaccines in the future - but for now, while they are experimental and you take it anyway, you are going to lose the fight. You didn't have to take the experimental drug. If you die, they will try to get out of paying.::Same!::I like Forbes. You like Forbes?::Not to mention that there is evidence that mRNA vaccine technology may inhibit the production of proteins that inhibit the development of tumors. Will we see a marked increase in cancer among the population that accepts these new vaccines?::I dont understand how people dont see this. That they cant fathom this is where we are.::I called, and have seen posts from others who called. They can get out of paying if you take an experimental vaccine, and die, and all of these vaccines are experimental. Until they are not, then they can be used as reasons to not pay insurance claims.::I read that ALL the animals died upon exposure to the wild virus. So here they skipped the animal testing. How convenient.::It isnt fda approved. They skipped animal testing. It is a gene modification. People are dying from it. Others are having serious adverse reactions.::Trump was promising that it would be ready near the election. That rush I would have refused.::So I happened to have to go to one this weekend in Metro Atlanta (for a different purpose) and there were no cars. Not a one.::Ive already taken the st dose. Moderna::::This is a really uninformed opinion.::Im thinking that will be after the experimenting is over and the vaccines get full approval. Ill check them out then.::::Not sure where you are getting your information, but almost all is entirely wrong. Go to the sources- call the Insurance company - this one wrong item will hopefully get you to question the others.::Exactly!! to months shall be very telling!!::my deaf mother, who is in her late 's, called me this week(very rare - we normally correspond strictly by snail mail)to shout ""get the vaccine"" repeatedlyI sure hate lying to her, but I will::Couldnt agree more.::Did you really not know this? Bizarre how much faith you have in the media and a bunch of politicians who accept billions from Big Pharma. Im not an anti-vaxxer, but this isnt a vaccine.::Thats fine. Everyone makes their on decision with regards to vaccines. But there are alot of people who got covid and are suffering from long lasting effects. Some that are serious.::I listened to and . I learned not to trust it from them.::People of childbearing years, men and women, should be especially wary of these shots and they aren't really at-risk anyway. I'm older, if it comes down to it I will consider it but I'm not in any rush.::ovarian failureit's already a thing::out of curiosity, how did it change with an election?::What was hard to follow? Its not FDA approved. The vaccine was sent out under Emergency Use Authorization. Fauci said you still have to limit contact &amp; wear masks after you get the shot. Having traveled the world, after vaccination, I never had to hide from yellow fever.::Exactly. I suspect I may have to have one, maybe not, for a cruise in but at least we'll have a better idea what's happening by then.::Good. Don't. Get sick and tell us how it goes. Fucking idiot.::Agreed my friend!::President Trump had them developed with Operation Warp Speed.::And while I agree with you % of the time, this conspiracy anti/vaxx crap is looney.::Trump was a tyrant now?::Interesting that China, where this lab-leaked virus originated, is producing vaccines made of inactivated virus (like typical flu vaccines) vs mRNA, even though they have participated in mRNA research for years.::No joke. Dna is now pharmaceutically hackable and mandatory for you to exhist in your daily life, is literally where we are at....::Don't need it...solution to C19 is I*V*M. Check out FLCCC Alliance::This is breaking my heart. I dont want to take the vax. But I wont be able to see my children and my granddaughter if I dont.::I give it two years.::Wait until they start growing tails.::Except thats not a vaccine. A vaccine is the weaker form of the virus to trigger your body to produce immunity. This shot contains no COVID-19 virus. It contains mRNA to code your DNA to produce certain proteins. No thanks. Im good. And yes, this is a hill I would die on.::I'm not a test rat ! Hell no to any vaccination::You think Trump, Azar, Slaoui, and the folks in the Trump administration were all lying tyrants?You think they faked the trials and the hundred of millions of doses already given are actually killing everyone and theyre hiding it?::Yup::They want us to think that were a dwindling number but if it was true, why is there a PR campaign to convince us to get the shot? Why are most states blazing through their vaccine tiers? They also changed their language to everyone has been OFFERED the vaccine.::Trump is a tyrant? Interesting::What do you have against Trumps only achievement?::I got my shot. Ive since grown blue horns and have an uncontrollable urge to vote Democratic. Dont worry, be happy.::Many of them are also using aborted fetal tissue in them. I don't want that injected into my body. Novavax is one that may be approved for the USA soon. So far, nobody died or was hospitalized after receiving. No mRna, no aborted fetal tissue. I might consider that one.::What??? What changed that you will now take it???::Im disturbed by how many people arent bothered by this. Especially since it was a vaccine created under Trump and they hate him so much, I expected less compliance.::These are all EXPERIMENTAL vaccines. The mRna ones were tested back in - and many of the animals died when returned to the wild after getting them. If someone takes one and dies, their life insurance policy will not pay because the vaccines are experimental.::Me either.::Say what?::This is the hill I die on.::What are your concerns at this point? I wouldnt have taken one before the election, but I am encouraging everyone to get it now.::Its not a vaccine. Its an RNA remodeling experiment. Experimental gene therapy. After youre vaccinated, you dont have to keep hiding from the illness youre vaccinated against. Even your dog, after their vaccine, doesnt have to stay inside in case they catch rabies.::you see through the lying crap better than most. Thank you::They are not as available as media makes it look. Not a single one available in Orange County NY. NEW YORK!!! NONE!!!::So many people are positively giddy about getting their vaccine.::We're a dwindling number but I'm with you.::Agreed::Ran into someone today who said they were up for boosters too as new variants and strains come down the pike. Wow, people really have swallowed it all hook line and sinker.",1

I *certainly* didn't. Those in peril should've stayed inside. The rest of us do personal risk evaluation.::I am elderly hut healthy. Hopefully, I am not a problem. I keep myself fit and eat sensibly, functioning as I always have. I note that the current ly fashionable virus only kills off those with co-morbidities, not just the old. I, and those like me, do not need saving.::I am elderly and don't need saving. Can anyone tell me what we are to be saved from? Apart from being suffocated with bullshit.::spot on, kids, young people have no need to take this 'shot' its insane::::imagine you'd find it hard to eat healthily on these wages angela::Old school elderly are healthier than the young? This is not even remotely close to the case in the US. It's a rare day if I ever see an elderly person in decent shape. I work with them every single day. Every one of them are on their last leg. They can't walk, diabetic, obese...::Is that what you believe? ""young being sacrificed to SAVE the elderly by wearing a mask?""They really have got you fully indoctrinated I feel sorry for you.::Thanks Lorraine. A good friend of mine also caught it in hospital while having an emergency op. She survived but it was touch &amp; go for weeks! it proves what i said that masks will not protect from an airborne virus and everyone is breathing in their own waste &amp; getting ill.::I'm and never wanted / want to be saved !!!!::Not exactly that elderly yet at . I also have no children, etc. if my own to consider. Should I really risk my life in later years for the sake of other people's children?I really think it is a no brainer. Of course I should, if necessary.::Phrases like save the elderly are inaccurate. Even vaxed elderly people are still at risk even with second injection. It should state, children are being used to possibly slightly reduce symptoms in elderly people.::I'm sure you are correct Angela. There's many other factors to throw in the mix too other than processed food which is a good point.::You mean some of the elderly who fought in wars::Good analogy and we all know it wouldn't happen.::Agreed. Its like an year old having an MMR jab for the sake of the kids.::agree::Dont make the mistake of equating done incthe name of the elderly with done at the request of the elderly::Bless her, sorry to hear that.::We should be protecting our babies not giving them a jab ( wont call it a vaccine) that will potentially harm them. Dont do this to your babies keep them safe.::The irony is that the real agenda is to genocide the elderly.::Totally agree with you and I know my year old mum who passed away the end of last year of old age would agree too. She was so cross that she was being used as an excuse when she said even I have an immune system she said shed refuse the vaccine::Being why am I asking the young to be sacrificed ? You have an opinion that it is a potentially dangerous vaccine it is only an opinion.::No one person should have to take a poison to protect another person. No matter their age. The vulnerable can shield, or not.. their choice.::That's the million $$$ question isnt it::Its nothing to do with saving anyone, The vaccine. Is to kill , as many people has possibly.::The majority of the elderly at risk would be retired and can stay at home if they felt they wanted to and targated shielding and financial help offered but destroying the country financially and the lives of the young is just not on. It's the directorial undertones that annoy me::Saw on BBC yesterday that the UK have bought over million vaccine doses already, and it's looks like they fully intend to use them all.::Looking fab for Deb::How would you explain that to a fat diabetic kid with a congenital heart problem?::Classed as ""elderly"" by the NHS &amp; the Gov't (but not in our opinion!) we do not wear masks, will not have the vax. &amp; have ignored the whole ""stay home"", distancing, nonsense from the start. But we HAVE had a precious year (2 summers) of our healthy retirement stolen. Time wasted.::That's just an excuse Bigpharma and bought medics are using. The real reason is depopulation and the more people they inject the greater chance that will happen.::As someone who is getting older on a daily basis - and the mother of a daughter, I agree wholeheartedly that my job is to protect her - not the other way around!::I totally agree. Im on the wrong side of half a century and no one should be sacrificed and live like we are. Children and the young deserve to grow up and not live in fear and have fun and a future like weve had.::The funny thing is Lorraine, Im not sure the vulnerable elderly are the ones pushing for that to happen.::The powers that be do not give a rat's tail about the elderly or the kids. This is all solely for something else that you know, I know, many know...if you know what I mean.::MeAnt vaccine uptake not intake::how about asking the 'Elderly' if they want that, most will so no, wtf you on about?::Maybe we should get all the people in Care homes that are in wheelchairs or bedridden to do a protest?::But the jabs are KILLING old people, not extending their lives.::It's not the elderly that are asking for it (or any of the measures). It is being falsely imposed in their name.::Same, I'm in fear for their future.::This Govts policies are nothing whatsoever to do with elderly v everybody else. They are about social compliance through fear. The plan is about control. Nothing over the last year was about preserving health. Nothing.::Most of the elderly don't want that either::%::They don't have to. They can decline the vaccine and not wear a mask.::Mine neither::Facts and Truth.::Its madness my children will never have the vaccine done and they wont wear masks !::Spot on Katy::I'm , and probably on borrowed time NOW I find it RIDICULOUS that we are now being coerced to have a vaccine to safeguard OTHERS Since whenA vaccine used to be given to protect OURSELVES from certain diseasesThe worlds going to hell on a handcart::Well we sacrificed the elderly early on.::...especially when kids pose so little risks anyway!::Well said indeed.::talk here!::I agree it's the Government.::The old are not insisting the young should have the jab. Its the government. I've seen no evidence the old are putting pressure on the government.::Sorry to hear that, the Government have made some dreadful calls.::So what would you suggest? I take it you either dont have, or you dont particularly care about your own elderly relatives - I really dont appreciate you saying that my mothers life is an inconvenience to you and your children.::They dont have too, SAY NO!!::The elderly are not to blame and most are saying 'not in my name'! the govt has used them as a reason/scapegoat to impose this useless stazi style lockdown on the country. imho the elderly have suffered the most, i have lost elderly relatives who caught covid in hospital!::Especially as there's no reason to think either will have any beneficial effect on the elderly. Masks can at least be argued about, but how does taking a vaccine that doesn't stop you catching and passing on a virus help anyone but yourself? The lack of logic in this is a new low::Personally I wouldn't want to go back there. Humanity was so tired, so confused, running around like chickens with their heads cut off, forever chasing something,totally brainwashed,lied to &amp;mesmerised.I am rooting for our complete awakening the deepstate magicians etc gone::Totally agree! But that is just an excuse being used to increase vaccine intake dont you think? Im mid s so not elderly yet but obvs middle aged no way would I want young to take vaccine for me!!::Been thinking same for a long time. My head is spinning. Only when the brain washed decides enough is enough, we can start seeing change. You saw the telegraph post, covid death data is wrong, in another said no covid spike at reopening schools. What more prove people want::I certainly object to children in school wearing masks all day, it's an obscenity. They are not at risk and they are no risk to their families either.::The truth finally slips out on MSM::Good for you!::I agree, that's why we need people to start opening their eyes as to what's going on. If not, theres no going back to the life we once knew.::I agree::I get you.::Speaking as an older person, we didn't ask anyone to save us. In any case it didn't work.::I'm not sure its something that the elderly would want either!::Im Unvaccinated &amp; non compliant with government guidelines.I dont SD or wear a maskIf questioned, my answer is exempt fuck offThat usually does the trickIve said from the very beginningWe need to learn to live with this, like the fluNo more lockdownDitch the masks!::plus I guess although I do know alot of fit over s.::I'm happy to take that risk.::If the jab works, the elderly and vulnerable are now protected. If the jab doesn't work, why on earth would we want our children to have it?::Well done Sue::The long term plan is not bathed in compassion.The opposite.Theyr governed by an insane core that has disseminated its influence throughout every govt &amp;institution on earth.They don't care if young or elderly..thr master plan is what matters them.Sheep need shocking into reality::I'm one of the elderly and no way will my grandchildren will be having the jab,the same as there was no way that I was having them thinking they might somehow harm me by coming near me,we've had kisses and cuddles all the way through,my body,my choice,leave the kids alone::I would be willing to bet that most elderly would agree with you.::Its not for the elderly anyways..that's just another cover story. Its about eugenics..something that has been unfolding for a long time. Even overpopulation is a myth.We need to look at the opposite of everything they say.::The elderly SHOULD have taken a stand and said not in my name, condemning lockdown, etc. The trick used was lifting Captain Tom up as a kind of archetype. It made the oldies live vicariously thru HIM. Its another bread &amp; circus tactic, training their inertia.::But it isn't about saving the elderly, it's about Wefism.::It's almost over don't subject your children to this vaccine not good.::my parents are elderly, they wouldnt expect anyone to have this 'thing' on their behalf. They wont even have it themselves, they can see what's going on, thankfully::I know it's the Government using the elderly for their own gains, it's unfair on the young and elderly what's going on.::Being elderly, I nor any friends have asked for the young to be sacrificed for us. Quite the opposite in fact::Most of the elderly ( old school ) are healthier than the young. You only need to realise the amount of processed foods they eat. In any case there is no need for vax. It really is people to wake up. Look::The parents and the parents alone are responsible for what goes into their children's bodies.::especially when all that bullshit isn't saving anyone and is only doing massive harm.::Why blame the elderly? Don't you see that it is a ruse to divide isolate and eliminate the old? It's been very successful too with no family allowed into hospitals. I don't know one old person who thinks this is a good idea.::Im nearer the finish line than you but couldnt agree more::Kids being injected and wearing masks will do absolutely nothing to save the elderly. Its a charade to get parents to agree.::I dont think the elderly want the young to save them. Where do you get that idea?::I know it's the Government using the elderly for their own gains.::I am and in no way wanted youngsters to be treated like pariahs to save me.I was prepared to take my own chances I have had a life our poor young havent I have seen what this fiasco has done to my grandkids.God Bless all the youngsters and to them I say:go out and LIVE!!::I would suspect that all elderly people would also agree with you!::No one is being saved really though. The elderly are being killed off, either by imprisonment or the jab, and the young are having, what should be seen as their best years denied, their mental health is being destroyed. No winners here. Only the gov and their agenda.::Yep agreed, theres one thing for certain, theres not one minister in the Tory ranks going to divulge that answer!::The counter argument is that older folk are wiser, less fuelled by ambition &amp; testosterone and have kids &amp; grandkids they nurtured &amp; love &amp; want a place where they can grow and thrive. Young are selfish, dumb &amp; replaced in fewer years than older folks who have paid their way..::Nor compromise their education, mental health, job prospects, financial security &amp; life! Its immoral, unethical and just plain stupid.::It's not to save the elderly it's to save everyone young or old.::Goodness no. You're just a spring chicken. I'm and nowhere near elderly.::Agreed. What is shocking is that they have accepted it as being their due. They have NOT stood up and said, Not in our name!::Fingers crossed people will start to be held to account very soon.::It would not be acceptable to inject an experimental vaccine into our children to save the elderly even if there was a deadly virus rampant in our country.::We are all responsible for our own bodies, not anybody elses::I'm guessing you don't work for any of the services that have had to watch all ages die to covid, unable to do anything about it. If you had watched whole families dying from this would you have the same opinion. If you're child died due to not wearing a mask would think this way::Of course they shouldnt. I am praying that many parents will say no. This is just one massive experiment and children are the guinea pigs.::I am ,I have approx.5years on average to live.I have been locked down &amp; % of my life taken for a disease which I have in ,chance of dying from. A person in their 's has had % of their life taken locked down.I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY STUPID THINGS.::Am not sure if youre serious but if you are - why is your life worth more than a childs right to play, make positive memories, involve themselves in group activities, go on holiday, take exams, get a driving license, enjoy all that Uni has to offer etc?Serious question btw::Totally agree. Have told my kids exactly this. Ashamed of/disgusted with anyone who thinks it is ok to stop/restrict education, playtime, holidays, sleepovers &amp; the fun of childhood, cancel important exams, driving lessons etc so an yr old can get an extra months, insane imo::Totally and absolutely agree!I am and have grandchildren. I am completely opposed to state-sponsored child abuse, which is what I consider these measures to be.I had my jabs - reluctantly - to save the young from vaccinations and mask-wearing.::That's the illusion that most ppl will buy, they want us all vaccinated at all costs, well they can I will not aquiesce::You are so right. Children have to live normally not like biohazards.::If anything (not that the virus is deadly anyway) we unjabbed are at risk, but choosing own risk, from the jabbed if they can still catch and pass it on.::Bless you Josie.::This is the truth of the matter::Im sure most of the elderly are made of sterner stuff than the government would have you believe. Its disgraceful that they have been used to inflict distress on the young. I can assure you it was not in my name. Im so angry at what has been deliberately inflicted on the U.K.::Exactly, why is this not asked at the briefings......obviously because they would have to admit there is no valid reason to vaccinate every single soul, so why do they want everyone vaxxed is the only real question!::What we really have is a problem with the government and its advisers.They are giving people a skewed idea of the risks of Covid and it's causing unnecessary fear and division.::Used to think that but not now..I think its about controlling every single citizen in the UK..::We never asked them too. We are capable of protecting ourselves. If your generations weren't such Snowflakes and brainwashed petrified puppets, The Government wouldn't be able to do this. You Created it, You Live with it.::Thank you for considering my life isn't worth a shot and a piece of cloth.::It's about what facts you choose. Vaers is out of whack. Someone dies in a car crash they'll blame the vaccine. A simple plain irrefutable fact is more women die in pregnancy and childbirth than all vaccines put together. Shall we ban pregnancy?::I am not young. I am history. Future is for the young.::Here here::This Carbon based life form was found in an independent study of the V- it is Alive..A parasite..not unlike Toxoplasma GondiiSemper Fi::This is a fallacy. The young have zero impact on the old and COVID. Could the young stop the old and weak dying of the flu?::The elderly do not want the young to be vaccinated, they are happy to be accountable for themselves. It as the Government which is doing the sacrificing. No opposition to hold them to account.::It's all mad, I just wish people would take back control of their lives and stop with this nonsense.::I dont understand the save the elderly vibe. Still cant get an answer to the question... if someone is jabbed, what do they have to fear from the unjabbed::I haven't complied with any of the nonsense but most people have. I am quite aware that the Government are using the elderly for their own means but want more people to see it.::I don't, I don't comply to any of the nonsense, I am quite aware that the Government are using the elderly for their own means, I just want more people to see it.::It's nothing to do with saving the elderly, haven't you cottoned on yet!::I just wish people would stop complying to the nonsense,it may end then.::Totally agree, it's our job to protect the children not the other way round. This is a psychological attack on children.::Yes. &amp; human capital market slavery. has done lucid, thorough, apolitical research on this. Please follow Encourage all to watch holocaust survivor Vera Sharav (pinned to my account) warning us about covid coup/ medical fascism::Around here most of the elderly are in better shape than the young.::Why would we need to save the elderly when they have all been vaccinated::I'm pretty sure most elderly would agree with you but its not your average oap making the rules.::The young aren't being sacrificed for the elderly, that's the marketing sell. Everyone is being trained to be obedient for control. You can't install the Great Reset without control. The silent war.You have propagandized tunnel vision.::What about , I am fighting for my grandkids::Really funny thing I saw today; young teenager coming out of elderly persons bungalow (Ill assume grand parents home) and as he got to the path he put his face muzzle on. The utter madness. Totally brainwashed!!!::I'm an fart I don't want my kids lives ended because of Boris the dickhead!::It wont save anyone let alone the elderly::I couldnt agree more::I know it's the Government, I don't blame the elderly.::I know it's the Government making the elderly a scape goat for their own means. So sad.::oh wait are we saving granny again?::Its not saving us elderly either. Its another guilt trip to keep people compliant.Even if I believed it,I would not want the young to suffer to save me! Im quite capable of saving myself and take full responsibility for that. I know so many people my age who feel that way.::Don't ever think it is the elderly you are saving. They have culled thousands before their time in the NHS. Gosport War Memorial hospital, Liverpool care pathway and many more. All about the elderly to start with but now vaccinating children, should make people think::Pls remember that the elderly were not asked if they WANTED govt (or young ppl) to be sacrificed for them - if you did the majority would think the idea totally unacceptable. It is only the fascist govt using them as an excuse to tell you you should sacrifice yourselves for them.::Definitely::I know its madness but that's the plan to sterilise the fertile::The elderly I know also have a problem with that!! I'm supposed to be ""vulnerable"" and feel the same way! Leave everyone else out of it and let us decide for ourselves if we want to be protected!! It's horrible to see everyone suffer for the sake of the few.::Wow. Great man::Said this from the start. Have the elderly even been asked? No just isolated, stopped from seeing loved ones and then jabbed!::::Definitely not.::Ditto..... does count as elderly? I hope not::Yes. And that's exactly what my wise year old Dad said from the very start. His sensible attitude is that we've all got to go some time and it is wrong to sacrifice young people's lives so that he might live a bit longer. Lockdown has condemned so many to early deaths.::I don't blame the elderly, I blame the Government for making them the scape goat.::All part of the psy-op, save the NHS, save the elderly, don't kill granny...They wanted to dispose of what they think are the useless eaters first - the sick and elderly, next make kids and the rest infertile but able to work and pay taxes to keep the tyrants comfortable.::With the greatest respect elderly people dont make the rules, they usually are the quietest not wishing to cause problems.::It's nonsense::You're welcome::Thank you lol::I am, I love them. Just for you.::Ur addicted to emojis::I'm proud of you.::I totally agree with you, I am elderly, but would not expect anyone to sacrifice anything for me. This is mind control by the government, ignore and lead your life the way you want. Also, I will not have the jab, never worn a mask.::Ahh, I didn't remember using one::Emoji lol::I hope we can.Too many are still sleepwalking.::What palm tree?::Not if we stop it.::You shouldn't let them then FFS!..We elderly have always be taken care of ourselves, unless put into a care home where nobody cares!..We've survived through a lot of shite that the young ones will never know of or get to experience, but it was never a hardship!..::The elderly are allowed out of the care homes now, they were the most vulnerable so why they are still going down the route of jabbing and masking the kids? It's just criminal::Note that it is not the elderly who are asking for this.::It's about conditioning the kids for their future of totalitarianism::They aren't being used to save the elderly they want us all jabbed and tracked like cattle. Nice palm tree BTW::Yes. I keep repeating this: speak to scores of people every week, past year, &amp; all elderly people (&amp; all working class) know this is fascism - nothing to do with 'protecting' anyone.Even lockdown supporters admit it's BS, but 'enjoy working from home' etc::Im with you. I am so appalled. The people running this, advocating this are beyond evil::You absolutely right Lorraine.::Appealing to humanities kindness and generosity to help Dogs and cats truly in need. Cant seem to get the ball rolling, in need of lots of help to achieve this career change for the many cats and dogs. Many thanks Rick and Axel.::Exactly, and most older people want to manage their own risks and live their lives. My Dad and in laws have gone out every day throughout lockdown. People know what is best for them.::Saving the elderly is just the cover story. They want to vax kids to either kill them or render them sterile. It's ALL about population control.::I'm sure most grandparents wouldn't want the lives of their grandchildren to suffer but the Government just keep plugging it ,it's so wrong.We should all be able to chose what we can and can't do.::Thing is, I don't think the elderly want it either, certainly none that I know. They also don't want to be told what they can and can't do",1

The amount of propaganda &amp; coercion involved is also alarming and makes me even more sure of my decision.::The problem is the Public has too many doubts about the vaccine and statistics used by government advisers seem too easily refuted by other detailed statistics::exactly whyi ll give it afew years to see the side effects!::Im saying not everyone needs one and not everyone will have one either. No lives acceptable you will be locked forever then as a vaccines wont eradicate all deaths. Flu vaccines doesnt so nor will this. So your basically happy to be restricted forever::Of course they know who the vulnerable are the people they are rolling out the vaccine to first. We can locate them for a vaccines but not for targeted shielding?::And I said this was fast tracked with no heed of serious after effects, that could take years to materialise but Hey Who cares? I do&lt; which is why I am NOT having the jab. period.::Nurse gets Bell's Palsy after Covid vaccine. I'm a NO on this vaccine.::Probs best to scrap the vaccine and let people die of a preventable disease every year instead?::Bet you cant answer that one? What level ofLives is acceptable?::What about all the other lives lost through million missed cancer screenings or the millions of missed cardiology appointments ? Fuck then lives yeh? Viruss dont go away even with vaccines. Whats the number of deaths you would want reached to reopen at what level is ok?::But he didnt die and nor do most people infected. This is why targeted shielding would be more appropriate::Is ignorance bliss?::Stop being lazy and do your own research.That way you'll know yourself.Funny how people like you ask then be so flippant to answersLike the cdc above. Its not the uk so doesn't matter?Its the same vaccine fgs::I get older people will struggle as will yeh vulnerable but I am referring to % of the population would have no issues::Yeh but it can cope with it. Example my year old dad. My year old boss. My year old brother. All no real issues other than feeling a bit crappy like a cold or a mild flu. So its nothing to do with being stupid. Unless your suggesting no one had recovered from it?::Might be worth mentioning the large donation mhra received to approve the vaccine.::You take a vaccine for a virus with a survival rate of %. Just think about that !::If you go into the British Medical Journal link I provided you can find what you want. I pointed you in that direction do the research for yourself::""Slammed"". Did it hurt?::Dont take the vaccine::False figures. in have NOT died of Covid at all . in1000 associated deaths. A pandemic so bad they have to inflate the figures::This country needs more people like you Sir. Working for the people not against them.::I agree with you and I'm not having it either and I can name many more people who feel the same.::Link please?::Can you believe people would take a vaccine from a eugenisist?::And this is why::Reckless to take it.::I will not take it::Does everyone need a vaccine for covid? I highly doubt it. Most peoples IMMUNE system deal with it naturally. Or are you another person who forgets we have one?::If you didnt take vaccines before why should you now? Or why should you be pressurised into doing it? I havent taken a vaccine in years as Im healthy and dont need one.::Your the only Politician talking sense and telling it as it is, keep it up::Even more pertinently, the manufacturers are exempt from any liability should the vaccines cause any serious harm, defects or side effects!!! This alone should be enough to put anyone off. If they are THAT confident in it, why dont they back it up and accept responsibility!::Mea culpa. My bad. Apologies.::you are clearly misinformed but carry on::But they haven't been. So you're not only irresponsible and reckless, but you're also a spreader of lies. Which is the worst?::Personally, Im for free speech all round. And not much of it about.The back of Khan is essential, but not going to happen. TOO MANY others! FGS get together and decide who could win and back-each-other ... instead of splitting the opposition vote.::I just looked at ONS data. Median is around but Mean is closer to . A relatively small percentage change still represents tens of thousands of lives. It is deeply insensitive to be dismissive of this::Not holding my breath on this one!::Youll find there are many in total agreement, and support you. However, you have a better platform to have your voice heard.::You are a legend. Ignore those clowns. Common sense isnt anti vax.::True. Hes lying. Only a madman would put that poison in their children.::Do you have a link to the high rates of adverse reactions::Well done to you, we are all free to choose::More chance of dying in a car accident, or getting cancer (and being denied a screening) and dying from that than ""coronavirus""If I get the vaccine I'm at risk of a bad allergic reaction, infertility, bells palsy, and unknown longterm affects they have AI ready to deal with.::You can have my dose, mate.::Thank you!They are not touching my body, inside or out. No matter how much they try and bribe and threaten - which they have to, because there is no virus to be scared of!::Where is the evidence of ""severe adverse effects"" that you refer to?::Seems new variant is far less deadly.::.... or at least like you I haven't seen the evidence he bases that claim on ... assuming of course it exists.::You surely know you need to back up this claim of ""High rates of severe adverse health effects"" with reliably sourced evidence ?::You might have a point IF that was what had been observed. Unfortunately for your argument, it isn't.::I will not have it ever::And when so much is still completely unknown:::GO ON DAVID ..WE LOVE YOU .............THIS() IS WHAT THE CORRUPT ,JOHNSON GOVERNMENT WANT FOR ITS PEOPLE..YEARS OF RELYING ON MEDICATION..TO FILL THE POWERFUL ELITES POCKETS..::Whether you take the vaccine or not is irrelevant.Most sensible people will take up the offer at the very first opportunity.::::You stand firm. We are not wrong for wanting natural health and freedom::Not to give your honest opinion would be the Reckless option.::You're respected for your honesty and integrity, something the authoritarian eugenics movement will always get upset about.::Keep up the good work David. You'll be surprised how many are behind you.::Congratulations, they realise that you are making an impact. btw. Please watch this video from 'Maverick Veteran' he is important in the vets, some very important things to say especially from :56 onwards. Might help understand Boris' EU deal::Like what ??????????::Shaun's been conditioned from day one to think and do what he's told. They're scared of you, David. I believe they'll push Shaun for obvious reasons, and he's all too happy to accept - hence the personal attack. Direct competition - expect more of it.::So you are cautious about a vaccine but campaign against control measures to stop the virus spreading.Deluded to the core. Perfect for London Mayor.::Not anti vax just common sense::What's reckless about not wanting to be a big pharma guinea pig?It's your decision &amp; your decision alone on what medical procedures is carried out on your body. is a piece of shit if he's trying to shame people into taking an unknown medical procedure.::Its ok stand in UR truth. Humanity is waking up genocide, the leaders of the future are fearless and corruption and shadow Gov no longer has place. if you want stand a chance of being next Mayor i suggest you grow some::Surely the answer is financial. These tried and tested drugs are cheap &amp; generate little income for pharmaceutical firms &amp; shareholders. Novel vaccines OTOH are lucrative. Every person w/ a voice on this shld declare their interests eg if funded by or shareholders in big pharma::Correct::Keep telling them David, even the WHO don't know what these vaccines are for::THIS. Consultant friends agree &amp; say a side effect could be eg leukemia but we can't know for + years. It's new tech. It's highly irresponsible of assure people of the Pfizer vaccine's safety when he *cannot* know that.::Don't blame you David::Keep going. Dont sell out. So many have. Keep your morals::That is the point I was trying to make!!! The more parties who enter the mayoral race the more split the vote. as khan has a massive minority? Muslim vote behind him ,the only way to unseat him is to vote for Bailey whether you like him or not::I would really like to think so. But why would the hospital use a stand in for the video with her colleagues and why doesn't she just do another interview reassuring people that she is fine? And why doesn't she private her FB a/c to stop people commenting on her photos?::I thank my parents who are in heaven everyday that they did not vax me and that I am healthy, none of my children or grandchildren are vaxed and all healthy too. Each to their own. Its called choice. And you are a rude obnoxious moron. Im done here::More adverse news coming in despite massive collusion to hide (worldwide) vaccine casualties from the general public.75-year-old Israeli male dies hours after being injected with Pfizer's vaccine.They claim ""initial examination shows no link""::???::I'm afraid Shaun Bailey has gone down in my estimation. Vaccines should be an informed choice, based on the data, not a compulsion. We need to make sure people who don't take the vaccine are not discriminated against. This applies to jobs and verbal abuse and slurs.::Muppet::Bailey is absolutely out of his depth!!....he's just chasing a big wage!!...khan is bloody useless...but Bailey is no better!!::Positivity can also be classed as naivety especially if you think khan will simply disappear! The more irrelevant parties in the mayoral election will just muddy the waters and guarantee khans re election and leave us with that idiot for the next years::::The nurse that fainted is very much alive::has done more for this country than the whole of the HoL put together!::You are being condemned by the usual ""SHEEP"" &amp; the GOEBBELS nazi type propagandists giving cover to the modern times sinister Dr Mengele type::::Well done! What about the Brits that took the Moderna trail and died? It will perm alt DNA.What about Tiffany Dover? It's too experimental. No thank you Mr Gates. Keep it!::I have had no vaccines and had none of those illnesses .. I did have mild chicken pox as a child. have you had those vaccines? And have you had those illnesses?::David Kurten:- Hero::::Dont waste your vote or Khan will be back::Please continue to stand up for your human rights!! We are standing with you::Coward::I think she may have been in the trials rather than the rollout. But signs point to Tiffany Dover unfortunately dying. I checked the register for myself but coincidentally one is offline and the other has an oops for that search.::We are born with an immune system that has evolved over millennia .. look after it and you would never need a man made vaccine.. with all the crap that is in them::Dont talk nonsense.::No one has died &amp; the one with Bells palsy claimed the symptoms came on day after the vaccination. Which is really clever as the USA has only been using the vaccine for days. Added to that there is no record of this supposed nurse on any register.::Yet the anaphylaxis were widely covered. The MSM cant help it self::Clearly he is a numbskull. Anyone with half a brain can research how unsafe it is. Your immune system has a higher success rate than this poisonous cocktail.::What if it takes to years before the side-effects manifest themselves?Highly plausible; especially when some of these COVID19 vaccines have been designed to manipulate our DNA. Either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine contains a luminous dye taken from a marine animal.::Stand by your convictions, you are not an ""anti Vaxxer"" whatever the fuck that is. You are a person who has come to their own conclusions after your own research &amp; not believed the pile of shite MSM &amp; government feed you - Well done::What high rates of severe adverse health effects have been observed. adverse reactions have been recorded in the UK to date &amp; it is unknown yet for the rest of the world. Effectively you have exaggerated what minimal information is known::Is 'designed' to. Doesnt 'stop' you. Hence why the flu vaccine is only -60% effective, silly.::Well yes it is if you think that shows anything other than people being ill.How many of those relate to the vaccine? And how many got pregnant from it?::Moderna shipped st experimental COVID vaccine in late Feb-20. How they manage that??And I have found x convincing report that states (no proof yet!) that Tiffany Dover - Alabama lady who fainted soon after receiving the Pfizer vaccine - is now dead.::Exactly. If they knew it did it would be all over their media but the fact that they are quiet about it shows they know that it doesnt. It is experimental.::I would too. Just to show they have every confidence in its safety and efficacy.::Here here for the antagonist in him. I presumed given his curiosity on the claims he was looking for more information, which is natural for someone who thinks critically. Instead he had his beliefs and wanted to test his cognitive dissonance. He lost to it.::Is it me? or is Jay on another planet?::Balanced you say?You tipped the scale when you brought in the epi-pen bullshit.Like I said. Im not here to teach you.::but they are not ill .. they are well ...your sounding retarded. Why would you put a vaccine in a healthy immune system when you are well?? ..::Missing the point entirely.::Yes I agree .::People that have test for cancer are usually showing symptoms. I think you need to stop::Stand your ground.You're right and the truth will prevail.I still don't understand how if it's as claimed % effective, why dont they know if it will stop spreading or you catching it. What does the do?::What high rate of adverse effects. k jabs with allergic reactions.::::Reasonable.::In an age when information is at our fingertips, ignorance is a choice. Do what I do - research, investigate, apply critical thought.I am not here to teach you. Nor do I care to row with you.Now roll your sleeve up and get in line FFS.::Hes not and never has pushed the lockdown narrative, he is anti lockdown.::Your words David are inspiring. Please keep up your efforts, dont be controlled by the evil narrative::Wonder if anyone whos had the vaccine, can they tell me that there lives returned to normal???Ill wait.............::Austrian FPO lawmaker Michael Schnedlitz administered a COVID19 PCR test to a glass of Coca-Cola during a session of parliament.The soft drink, tested positive for the coronavirus.::Mr Bailey is a right wing variant of a low information, indoctrinated Globalist 'woke' culture MinionLondoners deserve a mayor who represents We The People, not the establishmentKeep fighting for us David, you are a true British Patriot::Everyone has self interests lets be honest, ive heard nothing from him that would suggest hes a dick but if thats your opinion thats fine lol::Why do healthy people need a test to tell them they are unwell?::Yes and they have shares in the vaccine!! Why do healthy people need a vaccine?::Just take the vaccine ffs &amp; leave those who choose not to it alone ..::Whitty, valance &amp; hancock all have shares in the vaccine. But Hancock reports that there is no conflict of interest !!!::How can they expect people to be happy having an unknown vaccine that hasnt been tested properly. Vaccines are tested for twenty years or so before given it out willy nilly to people. Too many have already suffered adverse effects.::. The old piers Morgan one !::I dont think there are too many virologists on the SAGE panel either to be fair.There are a few doctors/scientists that know better than most and one of them is , id suggest having a listen to his opinions, hopefully it helps answer some of your questions.::I hope you never give in to the pressure they will no doubt put on you as you are a danger to their plans. What more do people need to see after this in order for the majority to reject the nonsense::You and me too. When all the adverse reactions including irreversible injuries become known remind them of what you said.::Shaun Bailey shut up and take the lot!::Will this do?::Exactly so, David.The Nuremberg Code was supposed to have put paid to using experimental vaccines on people.::well done for speaking out! The children of darkness hate the light::All this left, right, far right, far left talk is divide language. There's good people on the right &amp; left as there are bad people on the left &amp; right for freedom isn't exclusive to either.I no-longer see left v right, it's old speakIt's now Liberty v Tyranny.I choose liberty!::We should all have the choice.::you're::You have my vote. You have been one the men of the people since day of this nightmare. Thank you sir for everything you do. One of the few we can trust.::Official scientists ? .. like fauci? ..like witty? ..just a few hours research and you find they have a vested interest in getting the masses to take the vaccine.. I look at the scientists that are being silenced / mooted ..::yiur the man David. its just the legacy media at work playing there same old very tired boring game. Any one with a crumb of sense would see through these warn out games.::Dr john bergman is a chiropractor &amp; teacher .. I have followed him and watched all his seminars read many reviews and trust him. I find it easier to listen to him on YT than read his papers. You can read if you prefer. Try not being so condescending!!!::::I don't see what it has to do with anyone other than yourself. As long as people are informed of the ingredients and side effects, everyone should be free to make their own decisions.::Apparently, they were sad that there was no pandemic so they could test the new tech.::Not many people stop ,think and ask is "" is this safe?"" The ""fear propaganda machine "" has got them by the ""testicles""::You are reckless and irresponsible thats true. But the biggest crime is your. - Irrelevant!!::Pfizer's vax reduces absolute of risk of Covid by a paltry %. % &amp; rising adverse event rate, with widespread allergic reactions to PEG2000-DMG.

I get to decide what potentially risky medical procedures I undergo. No one else.::I call the vaccine ""The Darwin Award.""::Exactly &amp; espec for a virus with a survival rate of %!!! Its NOT Spanish Flu! Shaun's been livong under a rock if he hasnt realised its a CASEDEMIC we have, if the PCR testing stopped, life could be normal tomorrow!::Exactly David. I have always been pro-vaccine but I am hesitant to put a rushed, unproven vaccine into my body. Even the manufacturers admit they dont know all the side effects yet.::Interesting fact , % of healthcare staff and nurses are refusing to take this vaccine. I wonder how many more who feel sufficient trial data has not been disclosed for them to make informed choice and so refusing this mRNA vaccine, technology never experimented before.::I am in the UK.. I will take my info from whatever country is giving data .. it is the same virus all over the world and the same pfizer / moderna vaccine. % allergy reaction when the vaccine has only been out a couple weeks is alot!!::What is reckless and irresponsible is to roll out a vaccine with unknown long term adverse effects for an infection with a fatality rate of well under % across all age groups.::The truth::He talks like he was on blue Peter can't stand him! If London a wise they will vote for::... anaphylaxis...Dr. Matthew Heinz in Tucson, Arizona says; The reaction to the nd dose tends to be a little more of an intense response, which does make sense, considering your immune system has been exposed alreadyWe know NOTHING about this experiment. DONT DO IT::Difference is he is a paid elite cock sucker and you are not::have you read this mate. If you got some time its definitely worth it. Speaks about live vaccines, rna and dna vaccines. Issues and risks of vaccines. A total minefield lol::Govt has mismanaged C-19 crisis by focussing on getting a vaccine when we're basically firing at a constantly moving target as Coronaviruses constantly mutate. We'd get back to normality far quicker if there was medication GP's could give to people struggling to shake off C-19.::There's no such thing as bad publicity, now more people know your name!::Dont take it. Say youve had the virus already and you have immunity. Dont be contrary or theyll ship you off to some camp.::I will be joining you David. Absolutely not taking a vaccine I do not need.::::How is showing what the pfizer CEO said scaremongering? They havent proved that it stops transmission or people getting the illness so its not exactly bollocks is it?::::You're a disgraceful waste of space.::Whats irresponsible &amp; reckless is this government ignoring existing medical treatments that are available to treat vulnerable patients, saving lives, reducing hospital admissions and protecting the NHS....::You are being irresponsible whether you like it or not !::David Kurten might be far-right nutjob but he is speaking to Black Londoners here.

We need you::One party state as it is, the country is run by a small cabal of covid disciples with WEF deciding policy. As for Brexit and all the shouting about sovereignty::So no , youve never been there::What is wreckless is to smash the country's economy by lying about the severity of a coronavirus and using unreliable tests to bolster the narrative and try to create profit for your covid cronies by pushing an untrialled vaccine that isn't even necessary.

Trump wasn't impeached. If you understood how U.S. system works instead of listening to obvious biased garbage outlets, you would know he was never impeached as ONLY the Senate can impeached a President, which NEVER happened. You were simply fooled.::in get the pcr tests straight and I'm afraid in would be somewhere near as % have died with very very serious health conditions. I've lost family with very very serious problems and the country never shut down then. You keep taking your % pay pack::I'm on your side.::I would say you are sensible myself::there are a lot of 'irresponsible' and 'reckless' people then.. it' NOT anti-vax to not want an untrialed drug with unknown side-efects injected into your body..::Dont worry David.

Much larger sample size. But hey, if you want a zero risk life then feel free to stay under your rock::They said similar to Referendum and Trump. How'd that work?::Youll never reach stage::Aye - he didn't need to congratulate Joe Biden...::No. It's not tested and they are reporting adverse reactions. They do not know why yet, specifics, numbers or longevity so do not have written research on yet. Only reports which you can find in a simple search engine.::Well that might have been in your mind but certainly wasnt in your original tweet. No matter. I am confident that the vaccine is safer than the risk of illness. I'm also relaxed about the level of risk even though it is &gt;0::They don't have the information in UK yet because there is no long term testing, no testing on those on medication, on pregnant woman or on fertility, on separate age groups, blood types ect. The fact that there is advise out there suggesting to freeze sperm 'just in case'...::Having the right not to consent to a Vaxx/drug that's not been properly tested for long term health effects, 'reckless' Is giving consent.

That figure includes local pain, swelling or redness at the site of the jab. Really minor stuff. Read for yourself::Bailey is often given a platform on London media and he still can't lay a glove on commissar Khan. I've heard Bailey and his party approved covid bs. If I bother to vote itll be for D Kurten::Then they may also call every professional nurse in the Netherlands 'reckless' and 'irresponsible' for they - as a collective body in the Netherlands are ALL REFUSING TO TAKE THIS VACCINE - for they state:- ''We Are Not Your Guinea Pigs,' . . .::Nothing is certain,you preach and choose the negative and positives for your own agenda,but nothing gives you the qualifications to spread your scaremongering crap,there are vulnerable people that read your bollocks::Why should you be forced to take a vaccine??????this is simple stuff, basic human rights &amp; freedom.

The guy is clearly a loon.::I think that particular study was conducted by the CDC, as it stands there is very little information released regarding the significant issues the vaccines could cause and i dont think theyre due to release the full information until after years has passed.::Bailey must think that is getting a lot of support in his bid for London Mayor. That's because David is free thinking, intelligent, logical, a real 'people person' and he would be just what London needs, after all they've been thru.::No they really haven't. They may have died with a positive test.. Not the same thing::David Kurten, a real man of the free thinking people. He has every right to freedom of speech and I and many I know agree with him::When the flu vaccine first came out or any vaccine thats used for the first time nobody know what effect it has on people.

We have our rights and only fair to show opposing view.::well done for speaking truth and keeping your integrity x::It's reckless to even consider having the vaccine.::Your body, your mind, your choice, your opinion!::I stand with you with support.::That might be your point, but it's not his...""What is reckless is to roll it out when high rates of severe adverse health effects have been observed.""Which is untrue.::What are these side effects?::Well hes a frickin sell out::In that case he shown that he is weak. No leader at all. I back you % but Brian Rose is your main competitor. We need to formulate a clear message as to why you are the man and he is not::Except that just ain't true. Of course side effects happen. But they are rare. in Brits have died of Covid. Thats too many. So stop using infrequent side effects to peddle Anti Vaxx propaganda::It's the bloody lying duplicitous mendacious Boris Govt who is % IRRESPONSIBLE fgs! NINE months of Covid hell.

These sell-outs are on the wrong side of history. People can see what's happening and we're noting who is 'naughty' and who is 'nice.' We're not so easy to fool as they think. We want politicians who work FOR us, not against us. Like you::Bailey is a Tory shill, vote for him get Khan MK2.::Who in their right mind will take these aborted baby bio weaponry injections!! ? Bloody bullies and illuminati mob can get stuffed!::Shaun who?::The MSM will always put a label on anyone such as 'anti vax' or 'conspiracy' if you don't agree with their narrative so they can demonise any opposition so no debate is had. This has to stop. The truth must prevail to set people free from the tyranny of lies from the corrupt MSM.::My point being whats the point in taking a rushed vaccine they say has been tested robustly but then in another statement says they have NO data to back up any safety concerns::We would like to ask you a question please, Shaun.Do we assume you will take the vaccine, given all that has been written about it - and not written about it?What would you recommend that the People do?That is, based on your knowledge and research?::You can be personally cautious if you choose, but there have not been high rates of adverse effects seen with any of the vaccines. That's why they've been signed off by the MHRA.::shaunthesheep. let him take it. Freedom of choice. He obviously has no idea whats in it! Before he passes judgement he should educate himself.::It's not anti-vax to be cautious about a new type of vaccine. Literally no-one knows what the effects will be in months, or yrs.It's not a difficult point to grasp.My kids have had all childhood vaccines, but I wouldn't touch this one with a bargepole.::David the NHS leaflet states they have NO, I REPEAT NO DATA, available on those with a lowered immune system or underlying health issues. Noting that U16 aren't supposed to take it &amp; those who have allergies, we are left with the healthiest who suffer little to nil from virus::I am not in London, but if I was, your cautious an rational approach to this vaccine would get my vote. Bailey is obviously a Tory ""yes"" man, doing what CCHQ demands.::::Keep going &amp; standing up for the truth. With the survival rate of Covid19 over %, I am a lot more confident in surviving the virus compared with the long term side effects from a rushed vaccine. Most people don't research the ingredients of vaccines. This vaccine is dangerous.::Yes it was totally reckless. After day one they pulled back and told those of us with allergies we cannot have it. There are others with auto immune issues being told to take it with no regard for their health short or long term.::Youre irresponsible for downplaying the virus , encouraging your few dim supporters to not wear masks, not stick to social distancing , and not follow the lockdown rules.Youre reading from the Trump pandemic playbook - hows that working out?Will you get % of the vote ?::Please give us a link to where we can read about the severe adverse effects. Hint: a reputable source, please. Not QAnon.::Thank you David for speaking sense in a time of complete madness.

What a time to be alive.::He's wrong::Maybe it's because what you're saying is bollocks?::The hate is coming from people addicted to pharmaceutical drugs::I'm thinking of moving back to London to vote for you.::Thousands of cases including thalidomide cannot be wrong.::Well said buddie::liar -",1

Weird isnt it. weeks after st lot of vaccines and cases where I work have shot through the roof. Makes you wonder::It is always a gamble, they speculate how the virus will mutate and produce a vaccine for that mutation, very random benefits.::Nooooo!! Conspiracy::And still every year the flu shot increases along with the cases of flu. Surely if it is in anyway effective there would be a decrease, not an increase.::Already had the first dose, Sunday just gone Second dose is late-Jan.::I wouldn't need a paramedic for a long-term issue, highly unlikely to be attributable to this vaccine. Working in vaccine research for years, you'd already know that.Healthy with your own immunity... until you're not.::More than a coincidence that the ""new variant of CV19"" just happens right when the 'flu jab is rolled out in September.::If you end up getting Covid-19, and develop ARDS, you'll soon want a paramedic. Thankfully, I've had the first dose of vaccine to try and stop me getting it from you.::The foundation for this vaccine has been in development for many, many years against SARS and MERS (both severe respiratory illnesses, similar to SARS Cov-2 (Covid).::Big pharma?! You sound like a MAGA Trump supporter::The vaccine materials is in your body for -3 weeks. Once your body has developed a memory for the immune response, the vaccine is excreted. Where are you finding this false information?::years they have been working on the flu vaccine!::""2017 over excess winter deaths in England and Wales the highest recorded since /76, according to data released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The increase is thought to be a result of the prevalence of flu last year + ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine""::And the manufacturer would be held liable, plus I will be given full informed consent and if they have side effects I can stop taking them. How do you remove a vaccine?::That really is the stupidity of all this, wtf can't they see it::Not many and no prospect for most of us will until the Oxford one comes on line.A lot of NHS managers still seem to be working from home!Most front line NHS staff now test twice a week to protect patients and Covid outbreaks in hospitals.::No I would not never, but then I also wouldn't take medication of any kind all just toxic and designed to suppress symptoms.::::Why wait, if she is fine she can settle this now. If it was me I would be straight away putting people straight. Something is not right there. You will never settle the vaccine debate until you remove liability from manufacturers stop bullying others into getting it.::Hence the hype about the new strains, they can pass off the extra cases as a result of them, not the vax.::You said tell it to her family, so I assumed they'd spoken out or said something. I'm concerned as to the amount of seemingly ""fake"" vaccination videos. Maybe she'll speak out once the vaccination debate has settled.::Would you take an anti-hypertensive medication (lowers your blood pressure), because it's not safe for everyone? I may suffer dizziness as a side-effect, you may not. I'd rather take it than risk a stroke or heart disease.::Prove that she is not dead? Where have her family spoken out about anything. Total radio silence. It would take seconds of a video to prove she is still alive and doing well? But no total silence. Why? I want more than anything to be proved wrong on this.::Likewise - they can have mine. One thing that does concern me is those that have had it shed then we get some - masks will not stop it, we will take care as we have always done in many, many winters, eat well, keep warm, if feeling ill stay in bed,its called risk taking and life::Excellent as long as I am given a choice then that is fine, but to promote any medication that you have just admitted is not safe for everyone and the manufacturers won't take liability for is beyond irresponsible.::And winter.Usual increase.But this winter, everything is called Covid.Or should I say, Coronavirus, as it seems they are becoming less specific in their briefings and references...::I'm not taking responsibility for your health decisions. No medication is safe for everyone to take, hence you have a consultation prior. You will answer some questions before having the vaccine, which decide its safety for you. If unsafe, you won't have it.::Tiffany Dovers is not dead. Where have her family spoken out against the vaccine?::The only reason they may be busier is the staff who are staying home, over in one day apparently.::Yes if someone dies after having the vax, ""oh they would have died anyway"" Now the vax is out, the narrative is, ""don't worry if old people die, they do just die of old age you know"" where a month ago they were not allowed to just die.::Deaths from any cause within days of 'positive' test = C19 deaths. Deaths within hours or a few days of vax are 'nothing to do with' the vax. Hmm::It could also be due to flu, which no longer exists, because covid cured it??::Hence why they are putting it down as covid. They do the same for flu. If someone has a reaction to the shot, they say its fllu and would have happened anyway without the shot. How these people live with themselves i will never know.::Blimey. Its a possible. You need data::I agree::Yes it would be interesting to know how many had the vaccine!!::By that logic there is no need for a vaccine i haven't had one and I'm fine. How does you being ok prove the safety of a vaccine, that even the manufacturers say is not safe for everyone? Will you take full fiancial &amp; care responsibility if we get sick after having the vaccine.::Watching their TVs or listening to the news instead of looking around the streets to see if people are dropping dead of the so called deadly pandemic they have no chance. We are living in a clown world where lying creatures elected in are clearly against the people &amp; left to rule::Tell that to Tiffany Dovers family.

You'll be more unwell eating food with the low US food safety standards.::And the fcktards will still follow::They need to keep their fake pandemic going, so at first it was based on a fake testing system &amp; wuhan scenes for their mass media fear mongering for brainwashing the masses to believe rather than see Now they have the means with an introduced vaccine to create a real pandemic::Interesting::Also the bacterial pneumonia caused by mask wearing outside.::What they say and what is real is miles apart. I don't think hospitals are any busier than they are in previous years in the middle of winter::Seasonal plague...::Im sorry to hear that. Yes. I have heard this before re flu. The only reason why I dont think its the vaccine. ( this time ). Not always May I add. Is that they dont want to frighten people. They want to jab as many as possible::The hospitals will then admit them for a cold !!! Hence following orders. And fits nicely in with. admissions are outta control story ..... sage then tell BoJo. Lock em up its outta control. = country gets locked down. Boris dont need to face truth he fucked up::My dad had the exact same symptoms years ago after having had the flu shot.

Why stick with methods of old which had a track record of possible danger? At one point we must try and do better? All new though *must* have patient consent.::What happens to blood donors?Do they have to report vaccine status?Will recipients know vaccine status?What will happen if there's horrific side effects from mix &amp; match vaccines being injected into vulnerable patients?::Your true.::I am with you though, nobody should be forced to do anything especially for something with a +98% survival rate::You know mRNA is a better way to vaccinate than the old way?::This is exactly my stance.

So why is this wron‚Ä¶ https://t.co/13I1dKjLhv","Lol, he blocked me when he appeared to have been mistaken.::::And you're getting the hammer.::""Fringe"" means it was far from mainstream. Newsweek is a mainstream publication. Fox News is also mainstream. ""Mainstream"" isn't synonymous with ""good"".Also, an Op-Ed about constitutional law isn't birtherism. By those standards US News&amp;World and LA Times peddle birtherism.::No, it's fringe. It's been fringe since , when it got entirely bought out, fired its entire editorial staff, and reinvented itself. It's since peddled in birtherism and conspiratorial lies:::Newsweek is a shit paper, but it's not fringe.::The grant app isn't specific enough to conclude that. If it were in line with previous research, it would be GoF as they'd likely be modifying sequences of interest to test whether sequence divergence affected human spillover potential.::Saying you don't see racism because you follow her and generally agree with her scientific racism isn't the amazing claim you think it is.::You're hopeless, my good dudebro. It's whipping up anti-Chinese sentiment for a disproven conspiracy by someone who deals almost entirely in racial dog whistles, at a time of massive anti-Asian racism.::One more piece of evidence that Richard Ebright isn't addressing this with an open mind. He knows his ideas are fringe, which is why in formal communications he says either a natural zoonotic transfer or a lab leak are equally likely. On Twitter, his bias shows.::The point is its clearly not criticism of the Chinese people, the tweet had nothing to do with race.::In short, it's Sinophobia.::In short, none of this is sudden news, none of the coronaviruses studied were even close to SARS-CoV-2, and there's a lot of corroborating evidence strongly suggested Shi Zhengli's lab was not involved.::There's also this: how there's little genetic similarity between the two? Much lower than say, compared to RaTG13.::Newsweek is well know to be garbage and its softblock time, if you follow me to shout at people while absorbing nothing what is even the point.::Update: Sandy is not giving me hope with this attack of the wokes victimhood.::Claires public rep is not mud here like it is in most progressive circles in US (we are a backward nation) Sandy may be reachable. Give me hope Sandy!::It's also just, the research was also co-funded by the NIH for since , and the collaboration has gone on for years. We also know what strains of CoV they were cultivating, and what research they published. For example, from :::So I can get presuming this is about the CCP Sandy, but I urge you to look closer. There is just nothing to the lab leak stuff, its been clear for months.::Yup, I mean theres subtle issues here that Claire is well aware of.For example, some established Asian-Australians, who want nothing to do with CCP, and do not face the level of unchecked racism more precariously placed folk do, may give Claire a pass.::You have like replies to her, and most of them are in staunch agreement with her. And also, a myriad of claims like this... No wonder you're defending her so much.::Oh of course, you're Quillette's target audience. My mistake for engaging you in good faith:::So no, she's being Sinophobic. She just knows how to dress it up nicely for plausible deniability.::A government lab does not mean the government micromanagers every facet of the research. Nor does receiving a government grant mean that your research is being controlled by the government.Source: Worked for years in a lab funded by R01/R21 grants via the NIH.::No, it's not. It was, until . It's since become a rag and a shell of its former self.::Merely, the projects wish to characterize the biodiversity of CoV variants in bat populations, identify which ones have the highest risk of zoonotic transfer, via in virus infection experiments in cell cultures, receptor-binding assays.::Newsweek is an utterly mainstream publication.Regarding what was being done at the labs in Wuhan: you don't really know. There have been inconsistencies in data released about what had been sequenced and when, and there hasn't been any audit.CCP has not been transparent::Its a government lab, is it not? Ergo the criticism is levelled at Chinese authorities and the CCP. Youre quite clearly taking your wider issues with her and turning that tweet into something its not. No fair minded person would look at that and think racism.::In short, she's legitimizing a fringe conspiracy that seriously misrepresents the data.The project itself the thread refers to is this: None of this suggests any attempts to mutate viruses to better infect humans.::Cultural, demographic, and political power realities in Australia may force them to be more subtle than MAGAs but ita still bad. has helped document rising racism in Australia during the pandemic.Claire definitely knows what she is doing peddling conspiracy junk.::Because Newsweek in its current form is a fringe, conspiratorial outlet and is misrepresenting actual claims: research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology does study numerous coronaviruses, but the ones grow in the lab most similar to SARS-CoV-2 are not even close genetically.::re: Clive Hamilton, check this out for dog whistles galore, the lab leak stuff is a horse hes been trying to ride a while.::What's damning about the thread?::So sure, independent of any other evidence, I would give her the benefit of the doubt. Not with such a prolific history of racism, conspiracy peddling, and past fear-mongering.::And more (the actual thread she quotes is more damning):::And, more importantly, this isn't the first time she's tried to promote these conspiracy theories:::Also because its a line other clowns like Clive Hamilton have been running with in Australia.When the whole theory is entirely BS, stoking anti-Chinese resentment, to put it in Australian context, cant be excused as accidental collateral damage.::And finally, one of the central themes of Quillette is normalizing race science: Lehmann is smart: she knows how to structure an argument for plausible deniability. But she's promoting a discredited theory that panders to her racist audience.::She also has connections to Emile Kirkegaard, who has spent much of his career creating psuedojournals which self-cite and self-plagiarize to support the idea of significant differences between races:::She spent the earliest part of her career promoting human biodiversity, which is a euphemism for scientific racism, and entirely scrubbed that history when starting the publication Quillette.::Because Claire Lehmann has a long history of fueling racism, and knows how to make it palatable for a larger audience. The origins of a leaked virus also would not be directly due to the CCP, but to researchers at Wuhan Ins titute of Virology, all of which have been discredited.::Why would this be fuelling anti Asian racism? If its wrong, definitely call it out, but the criticism is clearly levelled at the CCP.::There will always be a small percentage of scientists who disagree with the available data, because scientists are subject to bias just like other humans.Shi Zhengli did not cultivate coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2, and her lab tested negative.::In fact, one of the leading signatories, Richard Ebright, seems to believe the default assumption should be a laboratory leak, and seems to promote any idea, no matter how poorly corroborated, to this effect.::Now, recently a WHO inquiry in Wuhan thoroughly discounted the idea of a laboratory leak. A small group of scientists are still open to the idea of a lab leak, however, as shown above, their data simply isn't supported by any corroborating evidence.::Even though her claims have been thoroughly rebutted, the paper that led to the idea of a vaccine origin for SARS-CoV-2 withdrawn and retracted prior to publishing, Claire Lehmann knows Sinophobic conspiracy theories will resonate with her audience.::The origin of this particular conspiracy theory comes from the idea laboratories in Wuhan were attempting to find a vaccine for HIV, accidentally creating SARS-CoV-2. This paper was thoroughly rebutted, retracted, and withdrawn.::Basically, Quillette's founder, Claire Lehmann, is pushing a refuted conspiracy theory to her Sinophobic audience. This is unsurprising, given their propensity to promote scientific racism, but discouraging since it spreads a racist conspiracy theory to a larger audience.::Finally, these authors demonstrate an accident from a laboratory would be highly unlikely: the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 found in the wild does not exist in any laboratory, was merely sequenced and is not cultivated in labs. Also, SARS-CoV-2 does not exist in the wild.::The idea of intentional release of an engineered virus from a laboratory is highly unlikely, and unsupported by any data, because there was at the time of writing no clear route of SARS-CoV-2 infection.::Next, a hypothesis suggested that the mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 occured through a recombinant virus from pangolins and bats. However, there were too many misalignments, and furthermore, these two species don't share habitats.::One, a retracted manuscript claimed the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 might have been engineered using an RBD domain that efficiently binds to ACE2, making the virus more infectious in humans. However, these supposedly engineered features are all natural.::Now, a few subsequent papers have also dispelled a few myths:::In order to generate SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture, it would require isolation of a progenitor virus with high-similarity, and repeated passes in cell cultures expressing a human-like ACE2 receptor. Also, the generation of O-linked glycans suggests involvement of the immune system.::The authors also directly explore the idea that SARS-CoV-2 acquired RBD mutations in cell culture. However, due to the presence of pangolins with coronaviruses with a near-identical RBD in their spike protein suggests natural selection.::There's also a high-level of similarity between SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses, with only differences in the highly-variable RBD in the spike protein. Pangolin coronaviruses have a spike protein very similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting natural selection.::Second, the virus itself does not come from any previously used viral backbone.::First, although the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein binds with high affinity, it's not ideal, strongly suggesting it is the result of natural selection.::There's simply no good evidence that there was any artificial engineering at play, and the evidence strongly supports the virus came from a natural origin from bats in Wuhan, especially, the Rhinolophus affinis bat.",1

No conspiracy theorist, just a concerned citizen.::He didnt ask about other vaccines. You sure youre a doctor? You seem a bit thick, mate.::Thats a nice way of putting it. Actually its far worse. Its also ironic that your government is telling you theyre desperately trying to save you by denying you access to places where you can buy food.::How do you prove it is safe? What makes you think if isnt? Im not saying one way or the other, Im trying to understand why people think it isnt safe when the overwhelming majority of medical experts say it is safe.::I hate to think with such low expectations but yes I think we have. I think there will be passports, but that is not the only way of pushing people to have them, there are many others and they have probably thought of them all.::shut up shill::Would you complain about not being allowed to travel?Not everyone travels just for a piss up but I get the point.::Until its proven safe then Ill have to holiday in Uk .... too many grey areas and red flags for me::Dont travel .... its a simple choice .... I value my health over a piss up in Tenerife::Truth can be dismissed by those with loud voices as conspiracy theories and truth can also be suppressed &amp; silenced:::Please please don't give up.

But let's not forget that there are millions that can't have this vax, either because of health issues, med issues and religious beliefs. So how will it work?::They can create the illusion of food shortages. Look at the panic buying at on the first round. They wont directly starve us. Same tactic with the vaccine!::Interesting article.

Surely the media wouldnt be able to put out all the bad press about vaccines if they really want everyone to have it. MSM do what they are told. Nothing makes sense.::It's one of those, if you want to go there, you get the necessary vaccines. I would just chose a country without the need. I'm happy to stay in the UK.::% they are coming... At least for international travel... I checked and currently if you travel to Poland you have to isolate on arrival but if you have a negative test or proof of vaccine you are free to go about your day...::Never give up !::I think that's part of what they are doing, but Covid/vaccine passports seem to have been in the works since before the pandemic so I have no doubt they are coming our way in some form.::Im not sure, I think all ideologies can have positives and negatives, maybe the best place to be is right in the middle of the circle.::yellow fever vaccine is required in a few African countries, but they are countries that few people visit anyway.::Heres a thought...if they havent been successful in mandating face coverings in shops...(government legislation permits exemptions)...will they be successful with v passports?::I would rather die than let the evil win::I'm unsure on your point. You need certain vaccines to travel to some countries do you not. So if you want to fly, you take the recommended vaccines. Choice is ultimately yours.::Keep strong, it wont come to these things they are to keep people in fear and depressed because they feed off that in their attempt for control.

Nice::Yes we have agreed to the Great Reset and all these communist rules and restrictions are linked to this project. People simply need to join the dots::I won't be having it, at least not for several years - until the true risks are known. Once everything starts opening up, the media will soon move on and the govt. will be keen to forget Covid, all this talk will get quietly forgotten I guess.::::Most of my friends say they won't accept the vaccine. I'm sure there will be small business owners who don't agree and we will use them. Could be a good thing if we turn our backs on the big global brands and turn more to our own communities. And if not, I'm leaving::No I don't. As in not for every day life. To fly to certain countries...Possibly, but we have to have certain injections to go to particular countries now anyway. Right now they are trying to convince people into the vax by believing there won't be a choice.::Don't worry. I'm not gonna take the vax either. If they bring in vax passports I will just buy a fake one. Job done.::There are many groups fighting against this. Not sure we will win but we must try.::Totally agree, and by separating/isolating us and locking us down is all part of the psychological plan. Add to that propaganda at every level being pushed in your face. I have to believe there are millions of us who do not agree to this its is morally and spiritually wrong!::They'll be going against the Nuremburg code if they do. Stay strong.::I will fight it. All.::Ill make an appointment and pay a hobo to have the jab for me so I get the passport::People must fight, this is dictatorship!::I'm totally with you on this...the recent news reports and headlines are shocking and designed to scare and coerce people into a corner. At the moment I don't want to take it I don't understand why anyone needs it the V when we all have a really high chance of surviving anyway::Thats the whole point of their tweets&amp; the media talking about it, its to make us feel hopeless and alone, like were the few but were not, Ive got care worker&amp; nhs friends that say theyre under a lot of pressure to take the jab but theyre willing to loose their job over it::Introducing Covid passports would be 'skating on very thin ice' Dave.Not everyone can have the 'vaccine' as they may have bad allergic reactions to certain drugs in the past.To stop people from entering a shop or bank because they do not have a passport is discrimination.::If the jab take up was as good as they are telling us why would they need fear campaigns? Remember the complete lies about testing numbers? Just crack on. And feck the shops that dont want your money.::Maybe its just a ploy to get people vaccinated, as you have just demonstrated, they are using psychology to push people into taking it because they believe there is no choice. The more people who dont have it, the stronger we are::::Thats exactly what I think. It would never work but if they say it might happen people will just take it. One of my friends has had it for just that reason &amp; I suspect millions will do the same::The fight is not lost.Plse share this petition.

It is packed full with information about these vaccines and more. At least they will be confronted with other sources of authoritative information.::No there will not be, is all coercion to have the killer jab::Dont listen to MSM!Lots of positive behind the scenes stuff going in...I live in hope::Yes, bully boy tactics. I hope its hollow threats because they fear there might not be universal take-up.::They are using social media to get a reaction. You have to remember MSM are the deep state::I am hoping there will be enough who refuse to make this unworkable. However I think these passports have been on the cards for a long time. We need to stay strong and if we feel the vaccine isnt for us, dont give in.::read this y'day. Haven't double checked it but it might just answer your question re Blair..::No there wont be. They are just threatening so more people take the vaccine.::Totally understand how you feel Dave, I feel the same. I knew we would get to this point but it still doesnt make it any easier::The only way they can enforce this is if countrys abroad demand it. Thinking about how much countries rely on tourism Im not so sure they will demand it. Maybe for the next months but then I think it will be dropped. Personal opinion only of course.::Blair and Morgan both don't seem to have the well-being of the UK people in mind with the former being a globalist and the latter intent on spreading division.The problem they have is an educated UK population who see dangers in experimental jabs hence the use of carrot and stick::Its mind games. They know a lot of people wont take it and this is their twisted way of encouraging uptake. Stay strong, I believe there are millions who will refuse. They just want you to think your on your own, but you are not.

Tough decision for lots of people but when science and docs say do it i trust that. Just my cents::Engineering and mechanics are definite while medicine is a practice.

Govts are pressuring, media throwing the propaganda in our face, using coercion. Lies lies and more lies for a jab. My body my choice, no child needs to be a lab rat they have no voice! It's experimental!::It's not a vaccine. It's an experimental shot that the FDA won't even approve. When someone bribes you to take it, you gotta wonder. Nevermind covid is patented, and so is the vaccine. Pass.::Time for those people to grow a set and straighten their backbone! Dont hand your children over to the corrupt governments. Think holocaust. Be strong for your children and grandchildren. You are just as guilty as the governments.::I certainly hope parents and others rebel strongly.::Research the and What governments are doing is illegal. Find out if you will be held responsible as an accomplice. Protect your children!::Home schooling is better than offering the kids up as lab rats. Parents MUST protect their children. Now, before it is too late. How many parents would hand their children over to a pedophile willing? It is much the same principle.::Not mine. That I can guarantee you.My kids still haven't worn a mask anywhere, including school.::F*** up!::Even if the numbers were high enough to officially call it a pandemic, we should really think about using a vaccin or not.::Its the fear factor running at full capacity. People need to stop watching the news... stop believing every bloody thing that is being spewed out of reporters mouths. Would we have even known of a virus if not for the fear factor? Im tired of the shite.::The flu causes more deaths in children than Covid.::Yeah! That is crazy!::We should start to use the real language for these jabs - Experimental Biological Agents. Its what they really are. Stop using the V word. Its newspeak.::They are going to start on kids and over here and I just told my friend you better call the school and tell them no::Saskatchewan Canada just stated they are going to mandate EVERYONE years old and up to take it...... and now we wait to watch the revolt take a new path.::And come on here to brag about it!

This way they do not feel alone and scared LIKE children.They are afraid if they do not inflict the abuse on the children then daddy government will do it to them. ie job lose, public shame, etc::Im not. No fucking way.

IGNORE.::absolute insanity. i fear its largely because they just want this nightmare to end. i cant imagine what some parents have been through.::How far removed from giving them McDonald's is this as an equivalent::Anyone under really needs to think of they want the vaccine or if they need the vaccine. Anyone under is just ridiculous::People seemed to become more terrified once the vaccine rolled out. months and now they panic::My daughter isnt getting it thats for sure.::Agreed.Starting tomorrow I am mocking then blocking anyone who even remotely suggests that the vaccine should be given to youngsters.::What are your opinions on the Great Reset?::Leave the Children Alone !!!::Sure, whatever fear the parent(s) have, is multiplied to the children. So they'll be lined up with masks for it. Don't question the Covid religion.::Start protesting outside clinic sites this is child abuse !::Nobody knows how that could affect the kids long term its fucking crazy people are doing this::Yeah fuck that bro!::If you first scare the population, then tell them you have something that will help/save them, they will load their own children on the trains for you.::::The Rothschilds and company lol. I'm not being mean here I respect you and being in the healthcare field I respect all that you do for your community. I appreciate your advice and hope we can still hodl together as this is our common ground::Get swole!::Eric. No doubt money is behind everything, however I would argue that most of us in the health care field just want to educate and help people. I will get my kids vaccinated to protect my (and your) families &amp; community.::Anyhow Im out boys going to the underground gym not arguing over vaccines since its my choice and I say no but its been fun xrp to the moon::My brother is the president of a major hospital system, and I am the director at a level trauma center, my father worked at the cdc his entire career, who are the powers that be??::Ya only allowed at Costco and Walmart its obvious the virus avoids those places but a small business or the gym omg Covid everywhere::Ill trust myself cause aint nobody coming to pay my bills and mortgage etc if something goes wrong and yes its very possible it can happen so Ill make my own choices thanks I dont need anyone esp the government doing it for me::Blessed day sir::I'm neutral my friend. There are things that bother me about this pandemic: One is that the survival rate is well over % a two is if this is really a pandemic there is no way in hell people still are aloud to go to work and shop and do whatever they want.::We would have to ask the powers that be..There is some incentive out there for sure::Haha especially Legault omg that guy with our ridiculous curfew for the last months+::Dont you have a doctor you trust? Do what he/she says. Not what you read on the internet.::We all need to work very hard in identifying our own echo chambers. This is % a false narrative, but you dont have to believe me, I only work in this field::Can u produce such documents? I work for a huge healthcare system. Absolutely no financial incentives... that is crazy talk.::And less Trudeau and legault and ford haha I cant stand any of them I want out::Well they get bonuses if they give out enough vaccine right so Im sorry but I could care less about their bonus and that alone is enough of a reason not to take it for me::My friend, as you have learned in crypto- you have to vet your source. As a physician I can tell you there are no doctors without an agenda telling anyone that vaccines are the wrong decision.::The problem is you got doctors and scientists telling you not to take it as well. So on one side people paid to tell you to take it. On the other side not paid saying not to take it::Yeah brother nice cowgirls down there::Im curious. When you guys get on airplanes and in your cars - with your children you trust the pilots and engineers and mechanics (without question even when it takes &lt; year to market) and yet you wont trust doctors and scientists to bring a population saving vaccine to u::Unbelievable::Its ok when xrp moons im moving to Texas fuck it::Yeah it's insane how people are sprinting to get vaccine...::% on a global news poll wtf::I actually called my insurance today to ask hey if something happens are you gonna pay out and they said no and right there i said yep no thanks Ill pass on the vaccine for that reason alone::I agree % bud",1

Glad you were specific!::As the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists wrote last year, Scientists are working on vaccines that spread like a disease.::What is now becoming obvious is that todays vaccines were deliberately designed to function asself-replicating vaccines, to spread the spike protein bioweapons to those who refuse to be vaccinated.::The spike protein is biologically active and causes blood clots, leading to strokes, heart attacks, pulmonary embolism and infertility effects.Pfizers own documentsreveal this phenomenon to be well known by vaccine developers.::People who are injected with the mRNA vaccine are having their bodies turned intobioweapons factories, churning out spike protein particles which they shed through their mouths and skin (and semen, by the way), infecting everyone around them.::Now, it turns out, they dont need mosquitoes. They have high-obedience humans ready to carry out the same role.::Never forget that Bill Gates has long wanted to use mosquitoes to carry vaccines so that people could be vaccinated against their own wishes (and completely without informed consent).",1

I dont want to be with anti'vaxers::I'm OK with that.::weeks ago I would have said nayNOW I'd say YAY.::Yay::Yes. What do you think you send to your kids schools every year? This is no different!::Just get help. Stop watching YouTube. Maybe read a good book. You have bought into every conspiracy about covid put out. Its sad.::I still have my military vaccine record &amp; have added to it just to have a hard copy Hep A, Hep B, and tetanus over the years cause I move so often &amp; health records dont always follow. Whats the big deal?::Fn yay::By all means, yes. Especially with the new variants.::As a middle school principal I was tasked with assuring all incoming sixth graders had received their full battery of inoculations before enrolling. Exceptions for religious or health only. I am a yes to v passports.::Yes please. We need to end the virus &amp; protect the vulnerable::Yes::Hell yay::% yay::Yay -::Yep.::::Proud to be vaccinated. YES::Get help!::Yay::What is a vaccine passport.::In Germany you can have a qr-code on your mobile after vaccinations. It's a smart way to show your status.::Yay::Yay::::YAY!!::Yay to travel from country to country or state to state. But nay to being able to buy or sell things.but lets be honest someone will over use the passport until it becomes too much::Yay!::Not sure its that simple. Well see::Yay::I see, sorry for the misunderstanding. Yes, I agree and believe that its in the work::Yay!::Thank you! Shots, vaccinesnot a new thing to those of us who have ever traveled out of Smalltown, USA, for sure.::Thats not JetBlues fault, thats yours.::Right? I had to get a set of travel vaccines and prove that I did in order to go to Kenya.::Yay::Considering that I had do provide my kids immunization records to enroll them in school or daycare, I dont see the issue.::Whatever keeps everyone safe has my vote::Yes totally.::Why not?::We have them here. Cannot go to daycare, primary schools, or any college without our immunization records aka Passports::Dozens of variants exist. Only those of concern get mention. What you didnt learn that on YouTube,::True. But it can be done.::Yay.::::Aye::Yay::Yes::Yes::Im good with one.::My dude - the Delta variant came from India. Check out the vaccine rates in that country. It didnt mutate here in the US. Try again!!::Yes, every action is a personal choice but that doesnt mean the choices available are morally equivalent.::Of course. Theres no rational argument against them and plenty to support them.::Even a citation proving this is true in farm animals given vaccines is a start. Obviously we know that overuse of antibiotics is a no no. The two arent the same though::Youve proven to be smarter than us in Canada, so yeay vaccine passport!::You are sort of right. Yes we can still get the virus - we just wont get very sick in most cases. We can still spread HOWEVER the amount of virus transmit is reduced by something like % so its very little chance someone gets Covid from us or that we produce variants::Yes::Yay.::Yay::So true! I'm worried about another shut down in the fall/winter. Some people are so selfish!::Nay!::Absolutely::yay::Good for them.::Yes for vaccine passports!::Did read the original message? It was about an email from the Ministry of Health, not any kind of digital certificate::YAY!::Yay!!!::Yay::yay::Yay, just like the vaccine record book I have from when I was a kid. You know b4 stuff was electronic. Why not::I already regularly carry a passport, why would we not have a page with vaccinations. Many countries require it for entry anyway.::Good question not sure::Yay::With bells on...::Yay.::Yay::Indefrent::Yay::Yea I don't get the fear these people have of masks. Masks actually make it harder on government to do facial recognition, so paranoid peeps should love it. Prevents common cold and flu. So business peeps should love it. It doesn't hurt. Only mildly annoying. Not much a down side::::NAY::Lol. Yes. This. I work in healthcare. We still wear our masks at work. Were all vaccinated in my office, so masks are optional. However, that added realization that we havent had a cold or the flu, it is worth wearing the mask to avoid those as well.::Abso-fucking-lootly! This will not be the last pandemic or germ warfare event. We must get cracking to protect life on planet earth. Lord HUMANS gave Covid to zoo animals + pets. If we want to claim the top of the Heap food chain, then we must take that responsibility.::Yay.::You base your ideas off a wrestling campaign? should really try reading actual studies instead of other people's interpretations of those studies.::Yay::Religious and medical exemptions but in high risk jobs, medical exemption might be disqualifying for employment. This would raise vax rates to a high enough level.::Some random person online who calls people names instead of having an intelligent conversation didn't convince you?? Yea I'll be wearing my mask for a while. Haven't been sick all year.::I am a nay because I think checking it places an undue burden on low level workers, and in fact puts them at risk.I prefer mandatory vaccination for government workers (military, CBP/ICE, corrections, all), health care workers, students, educators, arena workers, sports teams.::I am still confident in my choice to be alive and stay alive AND not make anyone sick who cant get vaccinated.::Yay!::Yes::Yay::took you a whole day to come up with that!?::Yes, Ive had a vaccination record that I needed to travel to Europe and Asia since the s. Its respectful to those you are visiting locally or far away.::::::Yes please.::Your gonna need them to travel to most places outside the US::People who are antivax never leave their area code. They dont have a say.::yes! and my only reason is so it pisses off conservatives::Aye.::Yay::Yay::This AF Brats family always travelled with docs that attested to their vaccines being current. Overseas, where we were stationed, it was required by the hosting nations.::Yay::Yea::::Yes.::Also, keep an eye out for this new Anti-Vax argument/Dog Whistle:""If you are vaccinated then you aren't protected, so don't worry about my mask""To this I say FUCK YOU. Get the Vax or wear a mask.::Nay too dystopian.::It's called a ""Shot Record,"" and had been normalized since AT LEAST WWII::Yay::Yay::Yay::Yay!!!!::Yay!::The degree in molecular biology I have is a start! I lived with a chef, we talked about cooking all the time.Im not a chef! Oh and your article, it support what am saying not you. Try reading it .::::Yes::Yes::Yep. NO email or card. Just paper. So annoying in this day n age. Most 'old' ppl have a cell. Lol.::Shot record Yes.::Yay::You just keep doing your YouTube research then. Just try not to get more people killed spreading you nonsense.::Yes.::I'm OK with it::Wrong! If the vaccine provide better overall protection then it is superior to you natural immune response.. also acquiring natural immunity may come with significantly higher risk which is not good overall.::The only problem is that the unvaxxed will spread it to the vaxxed &amp; unvaxxed the former of who can still become sick and die esp if they suffer from other conditions. Also the unvaxxed provide a reservoir for futher mutation. All must be vaxxed for future gens like smallpox was::Thats not how the immune system works. Have a stronger immune response long term is a good thing.::Yay::I would imagine a business here or there would require it, if you should seek EMPLOYMENT ..::Yay::Yay - get us a hard copy card for our wallets so it cannot be faked as well::Let's hope you are still here.::Yes!::Big yay::Put it on drivers licenses just like organ donor notification::Yes. Because folks lie.::I agree::Yay::I hear what ur saying. Again, Im vaccinated for those very reasons &amp; have no problem w/vaccine passports, esp since its nothing new. I just dont feel the vaccine should be mandatory. If some1 is anti-vax, fine, but accept the consequences/limitations that it may come with.::You receive a card from the nurses administering the shots. Thats all you need in my opinion::Yes::Yea::Yay. There's a lot of historical and modern precedent about requiring medical documentation to travel around. If you can't handle a piece of paper to go to Cabo, you should probably stay home.::Yay::Yay::I think that term, gives people the wrong impression.::Yay::Yay!::Exactly! If the anti-vaccine ppl would calm down &amp; REALLY think aboutthis is NOTHING new. There are MANY countries that require vaccines &amp; have been doing so for YEARS. I understand if some1 doesnt fully trust the vaccine, but dont whine/get upset if it limits ur travel::Yay. Countries have the right to protect their citizens. I have the right to expect not to be on an airplane next to a Covid-denying anti-vaxxer who takes no precautions.::Yay.::Definitely!::Exactlywhich is why I understand &amp; support countries wanting the covid vaccine to enter. Its not a big deal to me bc its nothing new. If someone doesnt want the vaccine or wants to wait until its fully FDA approved, Fine..but dont be upset/whine if U cant travel abroad.::Yay, all the way!::I still have the one required when my parents came to Canada in . Proof of vaccination for smallpox was mandatory! No big deal.::Yay. When you travel to some countries, State Department will recommend get certain vaccination. So, I agree with vaccine passport::Yep yep::Do it and ignore the crybabies.::Yay::I have no problem w/vaccine passports, Im vaccinated &amp; still wear a mask. I understand why countries, businesses/venues etc..would want to require them. However, I dont believe the vaccine should be forced, but I also believe they have to take the consequences that come w/it::Hi Dear, I am Sayed Hassan. I will do Best Youtube seo for Improving Video Ranking.To take my service please visit :::Yay::Hi Dear,I am Professional as a Social Media Marketer and Expert in Facebook MarketingTo take my service please visit::Yay::nd class is too good for them.::Nay. Too easy to make fake documents. Just require mandatory masks. If people dont like it they can drive. If they are caught using their mask as a chin strap fine them and ban them from the airline for yrs::Absolutely, yes, but its moot because its already required to prove vaccination status in many countries,and we have zero say in other nations rules. The Canadian requirement is not for Canadians, but for others entering Canada.::Yay::Yay::% Yes!::Yes::yay::Yay!::yay::Yes::Yay::Yay::Yay this is a global pandemic::You'll be doing it all over again anyway. Regardless if you've had the experimental fluid or not. Pandemics kill a lot more people than those that have died. Not just of covid,but cancer, sepsis, pneumonia, heart disease.etc. why no post mortems?::Yay::Very true::Yay::It's not a vaccine. It's an experimental fluid.::IMO, they already are.::Sure, whatever. Its not a big deal.::Yay::I have and all the shit associated with it is wildly dumb and usually a bad revenue generator. Have you ever gotten a passport? It's a nightmare.::Yay.::Yes.::Not breaking anything to me. Im an optimist. Thats not going to change.::An excuse for what?::I dont have a problem with it::Put the anti-vaxxers in a tent city just like sheriff Joe did in Arizona. The temperature is nice and toasty here and they will enjoy their stay.::How many times does it have to be explained that masks are to reduce transmission to OTHER PEOPLE by stopping your spit droplets from getting everywhere. You're also not immune just because you've had covid. Call yourself a sheep slayer but you're so uneducated it's hilarious::Yeah::Yes::I hope that Alberta has stepped up its game. Electronic medical records are important and before the information was recorded electronically vaccines were recorded by manufacturer, lot number, and expiration date on paper so that if there's an adverse reaction it can be reported.::Absolutely yea! It would simplify a lot of things.::I flew through Heathrow in right after a failed bombing attempt. Everyone underwent very thorough body search. Older lady was crying she was so humiliated. So yeah, a vaccine record is EASY.::Yay!!::I don't understand why ppl call it that &amp; scream how bad it is. Didn't our parents &amp; we have to have Vaccination Cards/Records for us &amp; then our children to enroll in school? I know I did &amp; I think I still have the cards w/my kids vaccines listed!::Why not ? It would improve safety for everyone; and loads of info about us is available anyway so that argument is not relevant. Such regulations may not have to last forever... especially if they re implemented promptly. Cheers.::Yay::Yesss::Choice is good, and as women we have always had a vested interest in choice over our bodies. Citizens have the choice to vaccinate, and establishments and other countries have the choice whether they admit folks not vaccinated.::Why not?::The are so selfish.::Yay::Yes. Of course.::Yep::Yay::When I lived in Alberta they did not track vaccines, when I went to hospital after having my hand slammed in a door they gave me a tetanus. If they had online records they would know I had had one in the last years. Result, I had a bad reaction. Online records are good.::I guess buddy has never been to a hospital, gone to school or driven on a road.::Definitely yes.::I think so those that don't need to feel ostracized they're not thinking of others::It's also my body, my choice. If I'm on a plane or at a concert, I have a right to not be exposed to intentionally negligent disease vectors.::JAWOHL HERR STURM FHRER. HE!L gamerpeep::Yay::The NHS app (not the search and trace one) provides a single page record of covid vaccinations.::Why not? Im proud that Im vaccinated! I want to shout it loudly everywhere I go!::It won't be an app. I don't know if you have noticed but the government is bad at everything::Poor you, perhaps having to put yourself out just because if you dont a deadly virus will mutate again and cause another wave of deaths. The weight of that app on your phone will be crippling. So sorry for you.::Definitely Yay. After being locked down for over a year I certainly don't want to be around any plague rats.::YAY::We already have them Frank theyre called vaccination (or shot) records::Well said.::Yay %::I feel like most people want a vaccine passport just so the anti vaxxers can be punished. I'm waiting in line at the registry right now to get my license renewed and I don't want to have to do this for another thing::The hypocrisy of a left leaning person wanting segregation and for others to be treated like nd class citizens is proof thhat the morals of the left are a farce.::Yay.::Sure.::Yes please. No need to spread anymore sickness::I just can't think of a way it wouldn't end up being wildly annoying and expensive just like every other passport and registry thing.::Yay!!::% Yay::Will vaccines stop the new coronavirus strains? Here's what scientists say.::No. For they can be easily forged. they are not officially approved by CDC yet. you cant trust humans. They suck.::Thats not foolproof. Anything printed cannot be considered proof::I was at the Santa Fe ,NM Farmers Market this morning. I live in the neighborhood. A couple walking in back of me (tourists by the sound of it) were talking about Covid, masks, vaccines. They were completely ignorant about all of it from their conversation. No masks of course.::Explain how the unvaxed endanger the vaxed. Make it make sense.::YES, indeed. All the others can wear their MAGA caps.::Yay::If we dont other countries will probably require it soon.::Being responsible is waiting for the vaccines to get full fda approval::Yay::I will not::Yay::Nay::Because your immunity is roughly % that of the immune response in those having had doses of the vaccine! Or maybe because failure to get it limits your ability to earn an income!::Your comment does not defend the ignorance of the original one.::Yay!!::Yay::In a NY minute.",0

We still dont have a concrete explanation. The WHO was denied access for a year and when they were let in the inspectors were vetted by the CCP. So spare me the BS. We need to know the truth.::That's what's frustrating. There will likely never be proof of natural origin or lab origin.::If they knew that to be the case, the wet markets would have been shut. As it stands, only the mouths of scientists at WIV have been shut, which makes me think they know more about the origin than they are letting on.::But I was told to even suggest this in was xenophobic, and that Trump was responsible for unleashing it on the world. Are you telling me that Democrats would align with the CCP to win an election? Of course they would. They are what we always said they were.::I have my opinion of the balance of probabilities for the two hypotheses; you have yours. Clearly, neither of us can shift the others position. Life goes on. Stay well.::It sure as hell almost completely shut down our economy. It destroyed huge numbers of businesses.::We can definitely agree on that, yes.::The US? We didn't let one get out and try to destroy the world!! US has had bio weapons since the s.::If you would have said the above from the onset (instead of being certain lab-leaks are unicorn-level scenarios) there would have been no polemic here. I agree we will likely not find the origin and both hypotheses are still on the table until some definitive evidence appears.::You are naive.::Lets agree: proof is going to be next to impossible unless either a really clear intermediate host animal is found, or data is found clearly showing the lab developed it. All the rest of this is just annoying each other.::We have plenty of knowledge on bio weapons. We've been making them since the s. We don't use them but we sure as hell know how to fight them.::Thank you.::A scientist from Austria wrote paper ""The genetic structure of SARSCoV2 does not rule out a laboratory origin.""::Those texts are not ""papers"" per se, they're reviews to a specific paper making a very specific inference. It has nothing to do with this discussion, because I (nor anyone else here) has claimed SARS-CoV-2 is based on a CoV ZC45 template.::You didn't notice anything else that Covid-19 did to our country? It destroyed the economy, destroyed lives and many businesses.::Darlene, the hundred or so people who followed Qanon have disbanded. It's hilarious that Dems think this was some kind of big deal.::Proof of nothing.::The speed of the vaccine development is due to technology surrounding mRNA vaccines, which have been used for animals for years. Pfizer and Moderna had vaccines developed about hours after the COVID genome sequencing was delivered to their labs.::The virus did far more than ""kill the elderly or overweight."". It killed our economy and increased the national debt by over trillion dollars - in the US alone - with similar results worldwide. If it was intended as a weapon, it was a successful one.::Agreed::Ill reiterate - I think the lab leak hypothesis is not impossible. But it needs evidence, more than guesses and attempts at dot-joining by people who dont know the science or its possibilities. However, that evidence is going to be super-hard to find.::Totally in agreement with you. Unfortunately, that plus Chinas authoritarian and paranoid instincts mean I dont think well ever find out, unless its natural and an intermediate animal host is found.::You can if you know the sequence. Making one ad hoc is a different challenge. Studies of the genome of SC2 think it isnt created.::wow, that escalated quickly. For everyone else:::No it wasnt. Youre wrong. Youre deluded and youre spreading misinformation.::Read the papers, which are by scientists far more expert than me.::Muting you. Goodbye.::We dont know. I dont understand why youre trying to force this. We almost surely wont ever find the origin. There are very few things that could tell us: an intermediate animal, a closer virus match. Alternatively, data from inside the lab showing the virus.::This is a good example of how damaging Trump was to science and discourse as a whole. A reasonable theory about an accidental leak gets lumped in with the ramblings of racist morons looking to score points and we get no closer to finding the actual truth about the origins of this::No it doesnt, Im not saying it is for sure either but the unprecedented rate of human to human transmission and the type of work being done in the WIV lab means that the lab leak theory shouldnt be so easily dismissed out of hand just because Trump said it::You cant be serious This is too dumb. Look at what it did???::So weve figured it out? LOL::It wasn't intended to kill large numbers. It was intended to kill an expendable portion (elderly) to create mass hysteria and fear in weak minded people. Frightened people are easy to control. Looks like it worked on most.::Where is all this much evidence that it occurred naturally?We should all want to learn the actual origins of this thing, natural or otherwise, without worrying about hurting someones feelings. If we refuse to follow this to its real conclusion, were doomed to repeat it.::Wrong again. You suck at this. Sorry.::The 'science' is in: the corona Cannot be artificially developed. The other 'common sense' is: as a bioweapon it is th or th rate. China does not do th rate work. They are wasting time and money. And looking to 'blame'; not 'fix'.::The outbreak was caused by a lab leakI'm not aware of its origin, other than that it doesn't exist in nature anymoreAnd that an outbreak wouldn't have occurred weren't it for those meddling scientists. It's the same with 's H1N1. Reappeared right after it was patented::Thank you::It isnt demonizing to want to figure out exactly how this happened, so as to avoid this ever happening again in our lifetimes.This would have been the first question asked, and rightfully so, years ago.But now wed rather make sure no ones feelings get hurt. Insane.::Nobody is suggesting bioweapon. Vaccine for a bioweapon. Details matter.::Those rebuttals address a specific paper, which I have not read, nor do I plan to.So I came in asking you to educate all of us why a virus can't be ""developed"" on existing backbones. Which you still haven't done.::The Wuhan corona virus is a China bioweapon. Why is that obvious fact so difficult for so-called intelligent people to accept?::Plenty of conspiracy supporters are saying it's lab created, workout showing the actual DNA markers they would be looking for.Plenty of peer reviewed journals, publishing the actual DNA, are saying it isn't.Who is the more credible?::It's the other way around. If people in Yunnan had antibodies, those antibodies would exert selective pressure, leading to competitive mutations.People in Wuhan had no antibodies, so it makes little sense that the virus travelled miles to mutate despite lack of pressure.::And random YouTube videos are worth more?Of course things were known about the virus. The Moderna team sequenced in for their mRNA vaccine in January .Once it's seen as not interesting, no need to keep looking for something that isn't there.::There is only one biosafety level-4 lab in China and its in Wuhan. Is that correct?::Jesus, journalists referencing forums. Have you even read the post quoting the % figure? That post is favourable to the lab-leak hypothesis and underlines % is an underestimate.But even assuming, % is true, what makes you think it's low? What is the % for zoonoses?::That's true. Someone may have contracted the virus and traveled to Wuhan, without infecting anyone along the way, and then spread the virus.::A counterargument is not vague claims and attacks, you need to present credible counter-evidence to refute the evidence which has already been presented.I'm going to stop responding to you since this is a waste of time, but I wish you the best.::Smashed Capitalism pretty good and provides a route for government control and socialism to take hold. Seems like it's enough of a first step for China to destabilize the world. Didn't take much work either....seems pretty effective to me::Fauci was connected to that Lab at the time.

Ive seen no definitive evidence either way.::How do you know it did? Thats where it was first identified. That doesnt mean thats the very first place that it transmitted to humans. You understand the difference, of course.::It killed our economy - didnt you know?!::I agree on the SARS cases. Meanwhile, precedent is useful in deciding where to set your null hypothesis.::I can google articles that say lab created or inconclusive and post them here too. But what is the point?

After its isolation there were occasions when lab studies led to leaks.::They include rebuttals of the concept that the virus was manufactured by working on earlier or other available forms, which is where you came in.::Covid is more infectious, yes. Whats your point?::God do I have to explain every tiny thing. Variants have emerged through people with weakened immune systems where the virus mutates to keep ahead of them. They then emerge with more infectious characteristics. Brazil, Kent, South Africa. Perhaps China?Where do you work?::Yes, thats obvious. That doesnt mean its made in nor escaped from a laboratory, though.::Lab leaks have an annual likelihood of % ()Precedent is useful for picking the null hypothesis when youre talking about the whole of nature and every zoonosis since the dawn of humans and animals.::Youre assuming there is more than one team.::You are take positions in the form of making claims without presenting evidence, e.g. ""plenty are saying it was lab created"" or a paper from Feb is ""worthless"". It was not worthless, it was a genomic analysis of covid-19 which had been sequenced a month earlier.::Cool or obtuse? No one is demonizing the Chinese People. However, the CCP deserves to be demonized. They are as toxic to their own people as they are to the rest of the world.::Nurses have been screaming this for over a year. Its easier to believe that Charlatan Fauci isnt it?::Keep believing that::Convince me of what? I havent even taken a position expect to say a scientific article from February is worthless evidence, which it is.::Do you really know the story?::Science Magazine finds most likely date for index case using several methods is very early November .::Phd David Martin the man who know all the dirty trails on the CV.::Because:1. Outbreak occured in an urban area with no known bat-SARS exposure.2. Virus was already genomically stable &amp; well adapted to hACE23. Intermediate host or place of infection missing4. BSL4 lab working on SARS viruses nearby, including GOF5. China hid evidence::China is a place not a race. Thinking people know that criticizing ""China"" is not criticizing the people but instead criticizing the communist dictatorship in China. The virus may or may not have come from the virology lab in Wuhan. Calling it a ""conspiracy"" is gross bias.::There is absolutely no evidence what so ever that this virus occurred naturally haha literally none at all.::Funny how Pfizer just happened to have started creating new supersize facilities in the US in to be ready for..........::Weak tea?? The only weak tea being served is the fact it came from a wet market in the winter.. only the truly moronic, the dumbest of the dumb, believe for a second it came ""naturally""..::Ron..you should have read the thread: It is not even Plausible.....it was debunked very early on. And, I do not blame the Chinese for NOT wanting 'people prying in their business - with the agenda to catch them being wrong'.::that's one piece of evidence. in a court of law you don't condemn someone on only one piece of evidence. but you gather and analyse it anyway for it MAY be an important part of a puzzle that will only reveal itself fully later. it may be nothing important as you say. let's see.::Why did the virus originate in Wuhan?::He wont find much. They cant even find the intermediate host between bats and people.::can we now finally call it the ? was right...::If all it took to convince you is what you are presenting here you should reconsider the processes you use to evaluate scientific evidence and understand the world. /2::I had heard such chatter a year ago, but people downplayed, attacked, or censored that information.::So now three scientific articles have been presented in this twitter and in rebuttal all that has been presented are youtube rants, vague claims that rebuttal papers exist and vague accusations about ""controlling the narrative"".You are not making a convincing case here /1::Most of America is overweight, or at least a large portion.::For the th time, ""precedence"" does NOT invalidate a hypothesis. The only thing that kept the SARS-CoV-1 lab accidents from &amp; from leading to a pandemic was the low reproduction number of the virus.If SARS-1 had an R0&gt;3 either accident could have been a pandemic.::It does if youre looking at your opponent as being overpopulation::As counter-arguments go, this isn't one. I'm not claiming the theory is true by any stretch, but if it got out DURING the weaponization experiments, who's to say what got out was the final product or that they ever would have been successful?::Over % of Chinese are overweight according to recent studies. That's million people.::It's amazing to see the ""virus from unknown origin"" reached Europe and the US in a few weeks, but it didn't travel by land a few hundred km to very large cities located near Wuhan. Were most Chinese vaccinated in previous years, and the pandemic is ""only"" a biowarfare test?::Plenty are saying lab created and plenty are saying we will never know because China destroyed the evidence. What we do know for sure is there has been a coordinated effort to control the narrative, which killed the debate.::Perhaps. But speaking from a Bayesian probability perspective, having ground zero next to a lab that works on the virus doesn't work in favor of zoonosisSars was a lab leak""Research doesn't make leaks happen"" is just your biased opinion, due to your background::I tested positive in Nov . As light as my symptoms were, NOTHING felt natural or normal. It felt like chemical was in my nose.::Sorry, what do rebuttals to a scientific paper I haven't mentioned in any of my comments have to do with the interview Ralph Baric gave to RAI?::Weak tea when workers in the lab were the first reported cases, or did these same folks just happen to all visit the wet market?::I tested positive in Nov . As light as my symptoms were, NOTHING felt natural or normal. It felt like chemical was in my nose.::And I would again point to this, and ask you why someone would post that fake screenshot:::The US terminated similar research back in due to fear of accidental release. Apparently that was a very prudent decision.::Ok sure, perhaps my tone was a bit aggressive. Again, that doesn't change the core message.::I don't need ""links"", I am well aware of the literature on SARS viruses. And RNA viruses in general.I want you to explain to me, in your own words, why it can't be ""developed"".::None of those diseases have spread as rapidly as COVID has, that is my point. COVID is much worse and didn't require global lockdowns to control the outbreak.::Dodging the point again. Yes, you obviously work in the media.::If you just blindly look at Ro which isn't a perfect metric you're right but look at how COVID has spread when compared to SARS, we've both lived through both pandemics, its very obvious COVID is far more infectious and spreads much easier than SARS.::A year later scientists are still saying that the weight of the evidence supports a natural cause. Science isn't % right all the time, it can only go on experiments and evidence. From what I've seen generally scientists in this field think Covid-19 has natural origins./3::. ""Precedent"" is not proof of anything. Are you aware of how the scientific method works?2. If precedent WAS proof, lab leak with still be a more reasonable hypothesis, since lab errors involving pathogens occur twice every week (according to the CDC).::SARS had a natural origin. Its very infectious (and deadly). MERS had a natural origin. Its infectious and deadly. Zika has a natural origin. Ebola has a natural origin. And so on and so on.What youve read *wants* to spin a story of a lab leak. Reality likely more boring.::On the origins of SARS-CoV-2, Nature Medicine, Jan which cites the previous article""all indications suggest that, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, this virus probably evolved in a bat host until an unknown spillover event into humans occurred.""/2::No. Every zoonosis in history, including those in the past two decades (SARS, MERS, Nipah, etc etc), has emerged from natural human-animal contact. No labs. Research doesnt make leaks happen. Youre trying to work backwards from a conclusion. Wrong approach.::Thats untrue. SARS (2002) had an R0 initially of to , but settled around . For Covid, its about - . The reason for variant emergence isnt simply lots of people got infected. Strongest hypothesis is its about specific people with weak immune systems getting infected.::Read a little more. It never says Covid was the bio-weapon.::There is no evidence for either thanks to evidence destruction.::::Here is another article in Natural Medicine March cited times which states:""It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.""Ok so what do papers in say:/1::Conspiracy theory?, The virus was found in nature. A bioweapons investigator is not a proffesional health::But those vulnerable ones cost quite a bit to each and every government via Social Security and Medicare. For another country where that is definitely the case, I would direct your attention to Greece.::It is still a scientific article using genomic comparisons of Covid-19 vs videos on youtube. If you think that article is wrong, present scientific studies rebutting it. Perhaps such article exist, this isn't my field.::Doesn't make sense as a bioweapon but what about population reduction?::Even with those numbers a lab leak is more likelyBecause you're comparing it with the probability of the ground zero being a fish market that's a walking distance from a lab that HAD the virus and did animal experimentsThere is a paper trail of grants and articles proving so::Why I'm skeptical of a natural origin is the fact that was so immediately infectious and from what I've read (I'm an engineer not a virologist) the gain of function research being conducted in the WIV lab was centered around seeing how infectious a coronavirus could become.::COVID is more infectious than SARS by orders of magnitude thats an established fact, we're lucky its less fatal. With the rate of spread among humans its no surprise that variants have emerged because they virus has been reproducing throughout the population so rapidly.::But thats for all labs, not L4s alone. Theres no number for BSL-4s. The risk is calculated, across all labs, as about % per year.::SARS-CoV-1 leaked not once, but twice from a Beijing lab in . Why is it suddenly unlikely that history repeats?::We cant evaluate the likelihood without a really good understanding of what GOF research can and cannot do. Doesnt help that there are two virology labs in/around Wuhan. Again, I dont rule out a lab leak; but I maintain it cant be the null hypothesis. Natural species jump is::That's pretty frequent when you are dealing with level lab danger. And those are the disclosed ones. There are probably x more. And the Chinese are not known for following protocolsAnd they were doing SC2 adjacent experiments in animals, higher likelihood of escape::Honestly if you believe this....Miss information to hide the truth::And most dont even believe in the virus::%::They are not frequent. For all the labs all across the world, there have been - from memory - a total of less than leaks, in years.::zonde dat er een wachtlijst is bij de GGZ!Laten ze peter gewoon los op twitter met rare ideeen en opruiende tweets.::Quite a leap from 'plausible' to ' very sure', no? Almost any hypothesis trumps the unfalsifiable OMB hypothesis. Pun intended.Still, a little heuristics applied to WIV history and GOF research is in order.::Theres as little evidence to support the lab leak hypothesis today as there was a year ago. Its possible that an animal intermediate will be found, but by now even if they do theres a big chunk of the internet that wont believe it even so.::We don't need to demonize anyone to investigate the very plausible possibility that a virus inadvertently escaped from the Wuhan lab while it was perhaps developing a vaccine. The Chinese have not been exactly forthcoming with WHO investigators.::They show it's not a recombinant of bat cov, sars and hiv. And perhaps correctly.But the nature article I sent clearly states that there were ongoing experiments with a SC2 adjacent virus going back to . That leaves out the escape part. But those are frequent::Go back and click the links where it says Review etc. Get back to me when youve read those, as I have done.::Don't you think it was very effective as economical weapon?::How many people with ""Covid symptoms"" were admitted to hospitals in Barcelona in when local sewer samples contained the virus - almost a year before the first cases in Wuhan?::Yes, they should write that. Even if SC2 was an accidental lab release they would write that. It's a correct disclaimer. There is no conclusive evidence chain to prove a lab leak (yet)But we're going there.::A year ago...::That article is from Feb , when literally nothing was known about the virus. Totally worthless.::No. There are entire papers behind the review links. They have considered the suggestions. And they show that they are not true.::This would fit, but I heard it was earlier - Oct. The Red Cross tested blood samples from Dec and found coronavirus antibodies. means that people had already contracted it and recovered. How long did it take for it to jump the pond?::Have you noticed how rapidly the new variants in humans have emerged and spread, during *lockdowns*? Is anyone suggesting a lab made those happen? SARS spread really fast and had a *worse* fatality rate. Again, labs not involved. This stuff happens naturally.::::I may have been mistaken on the HIV part. He has the most coherent argument on the Internet right now with over hours of content.Unlike your little paragraph total poorly written rebuttals::Quite.::Oh come on... Everybody knows it was Gain of Function. It is not possible that a natural Virus has as many Proteins for humans as for mice.::I know what a retrovirus is and what HIV is. RNA that uses reverse transcription to write itself in your DNA, infecting you permanentlyCovs don't reverse transcript. I read those. They are really bad. One paragraph each and try discrediting the article, not proving the opposite::And you took careful note of this bit at the top of the paper, right?::Theres a valid hypothesis for natural contact. What has me concerned is how fast its spread and the gain of function research being done at the WIV lab. Similar viruses have been found but the rate of spread is the outlier, leak from a GoF experiment answers that outlier::If Clint Richardson is your source on the HIV stuff, then Im not going to spend a moment watching any of that.::Yes, I read the rebuttalIn the paper I mentioned they speak of experimenting with recombinants that feature the properties of SC2 (from SHC014). So the virus did exist, at least for a while, in that lab. And Wuhan was given an ongoing grant for further study in .::Its happened in Australia, in the ever-escalating war upon our ultimate enemy: rabbits. Birds managed to carry the virus back from the isolated research labon another islandback to the mainland.::Except weirdly youre very sure about the one which fits the Trumpist trope (to the extent of inventing scenarios), rather than the scientific one which works on the null hypothesis that this is like every other zoonosis, ie originated naturally. How strange.::Correct, I don't know. Neither do you. I have no skin in any particular narrative.::Its absurd that the CCP is not being held accountable for this tragic world disaster.::If you dont understand what HIV is, and what the difference between a retrovirus and a coronavirus is, just say so. In the meantime, read the four reviews I linked you to, by scientists who are experts in the respective fields.::Demonize? China is a communist country. They have one of the worst humane records out there. You need to study history. The CCP is a dictatorship and has murdered millions throughout the years.::Never heard of Clint Richardson. What are his qualifications, exactly?::It is not more likely. You would need to create the virus; for it to escape; for someone to be infected with it (and bear in mind this doesnt transfer by touch; its aerosol-driven). Each step is incredibly unlikely. The first in particular.::I only claimed the spike was copied, perhaps wrongly. From a quick review of the articles, it seems that some subset of bat covs bind to ACE2, so that connection is probably unjustified::My sources are from Clint Richardsons Wagging the Dog documentary and the supplementary pdf which can be found on bitchuteThe video is here on yt, as a reporter you're probably aware of this by now. Perhaps you can share your opinion on it::While those are pretty weak rebuttals, by looking over my sources again I will admit you have a pointThe wuhan lab had grants for bat covs + published papers such as this, so a lab escape is still more likely. Even if similar viruses exist in the area::SC2 and HIV both have glycoprotein envelopes, though even those differ. But HIV doesnt bind to ACE2. Its a retrovirus, with a very different mechanism.::*accidental::Yes the more transparency we have the LESS conspiracy theories will develop. The more public trust will be gained. No matter how bad this looks.::Fascinating::Omg, imagine the conniption fit you all would have if the government did suggest people wear hazmat suits instead of masks.We'd all die laughing at you.::But its airborne with an Ro=14.8 and gets everyone sick with long term damage. Pretty effective.::Good point. mission was given no data, no documents, nor any evidence about anything to do with this issue by the Trump admin, which was in power up to (&amp; during first part of) our work in Wuhan. Seems to be pure politics at play here.::If your opponent is an out of control population then its perfect for thinning the herd.::I agree that Chinas approach doesnt help it, or anyone else. Equally: a media investigation getting done doesnt kill conspiracy theories. In the US, how many people wrongly think the voting system was rigged? Law courts, govt and media all investigated.::Darlene, no one, and I mean no one in the world gives a rats ass about a Canadians opinion.::Based on what we know today, the likeliest cause of Covid breaking out of Wuhan was carelessness and poor operating procedures. Anyone who understands China knows this to be endemic in every aspect of life in a top down economy where everyone wants to be a millionaire by sundown::It isnt. and::Not to be naive but in the US the media would have already done the investigations and slapped down the conspiracy theories.China behaving as they have, are powering the theories.::How is it weak tea when that lab in Wuhan was explicitly conducting gain-of-function research on Bat Coronaviruses they sampled from Yunnan and the closest known relative was sampled by them and they have at least more genetic sequences of viruses that they have not released?::It's a recombinant of sars, hiv and bat covOf course it's not ""lab made"", insofar as recombinants are not lab made. Sars doesn't exist in the wild anymore, so where did sars come from? With a binding to ACE2, which is HIV's spike::::Do you have a point, or are you just being obnoxious because its your default state?::But conveniently ignored all the discussion around the laureates view, and his obviously mistaken (because debunked) belief that its related to HIV. The potential to educate yourself on this is available. Start on Wikipedia.::I do think its *possible*. But the possibility is very remote. (Rapid Reviews - papers. ) Whereas SARS, Ebola, MERS, AIDS, vCJD everyones happy to agree its got an animal origin.Why is this one so very different?::I made no claim about having any expertise. Only pointed to Nobel laureate's view.::Im saying that its not the null hypothesis, and that to treat the lab leak hypothesis as somehow the overwhelming favourite goes against logic. I can see it as a possibility, but there are too many gaps for it to feel reasonable.As you say: we might never know.::Ive got a degree in a STEM subject, reported on science for + years, spoken to scientists repeatedly for stories, read science papers every week, reported on a novel zoonosis with a previously unseen disease mechanism. And you?::My degree is a STEM subject, Ive reported on science for + years, spoken to scientists, read science papers every week, reported on a novel disease with a previously unseen disease mechanism. How about you?::Except they didnt actually want to kill people with the virus. They wanted to kill economies and democracies, so it the closer it looked to a naturally occurring pandemic causing virus , the better.::Working age people are rarely hospitalized for the flu. /100,000 in the US. This was workers at the same lab at the same time::The point about every zoonosis coming from human-animal contact? Or what?::But heres some reading where all the stupid ideas are thoroughly rebutted. Enjoy.::One that kills the enemys economy, stifles their culture and paralyzes their government certainly is.::I notice hes described as controversial and referred to the Indian preprint which was hastily withdrawn because its authors didnt understand the first thing about reading a gene sequence. Montagnier thinks its linked to HIV. Its emphatically not.::It is founded speculation when the earliest cluster is apparently collated at the only lab in China where this sort of science is being practiced.::Look at this picture. THIS is how you keep from being infected with Covid. A paper mask, a strip of cotton or pulling your turtle neck up is not going to keep you healthy.::Most plausibly. So you dont know, but youd like it to be true, and they wont tell you, so you decide it must be true. Thats not really how it works.::Zoonoses have happened before and will happen again. Remind me - how many of every other novel zoonosis weve seen has come about from a lab leak?::You maybe need to read some more about bats, coronaviruses, human contact, how variants emerge in humans (its been in the news). Its very easy to offer a hypothesis for how it would emerge.::::The null hypothesis is that its a natural zoonotic event because every other zoonosis in history has occurred in just the same way. Im amazed that anyone who calls themself a scientist wouldnt start from that premise. Lab leaks are remarkably rare, at about per annum w/wide.::And here are the review rebuttals of the suggestions that have been raised that this is what WIV did.::Ask the real scientist, not me. You are supposed to be a journalist.::I didnt mean we cant synthesise it once we know the sequence. Obviously thats feasible. I meant that creating it ad hoc, starting from somewhere else. Read Gallo on this.::I really have no idea where I stand on this theory. The evidence is all over the place. But as to this argument, it would make sense if this was a trial run or trial run gone wrong.::Tell me where youre studying influenza, and Ill give you the links. Front up your qualifications.::Imagine the situation were reversed, and a team of Chinese and other international scientists were asking to see inside a US lab that China said had been the source of a novel virus. How keen do you think the USG would be on that? Chinas paranoid. The US hasnt helped.::Dang ... wouldnt surprise me at all. Just conjecture right now, though. Kinda makes the speed of vaccine creation make sense, then ...::Sure is convenient that everyone is willing to have an honest discussion about it, sans politics, now.::Every zoonosis that weve ever studied has come through natural interaction with animals and made a species jump. Please show the *evidence*, not conjecture, that this is any different. You underestimate nature when you ignore what it has done so many times before.::Demons deserve demonizing.::But Ive consistently said that the null hypothesis must be that it emerged from natural interaction and species jump, because *every other zoonosis has too*. The lab leak hypothesis requires many huge coincidences and events that are all incredibly hard/rare.::Says your a journalist in your bio.What are your scientific credentials?Don't have any?Oh, OKYour opinion is worth exactly the same as mine, then. Maybe less, depending on your experience.::Two pieces. From June and this more recently (though doesnt have the antibodies element - cant find that particular one just now ).Im not against the lab leak hypothesis (it isnt a theory; no predictive power.) /2::Love your work, .::What are your scientific credentials?::Ive read that scientists were long ago able to verify that the virus was NOT invented in a lab, by looking at DNA. Not being a scientist, I dont know what they found that indicates this, but Id put more stock in this, than ANY Murdoch info, that is usually LIES.::GOF research was taking place, from what I read. Its also taking place in the US. And, yes, human error and accidents do happen. Time for a risk-benefits analysis?::Thats the CCP taking point...::Golly. Do you think that they could have cultivating viruses at a virology lab? Could there have been research being done on existing viruses? Any chance the virus got picked up at a nearby wet market and found it's way onto a petri dish, unrecognised?::And who is to say they missed their intended mark not for lack of trying but because of biological complexity in humans and our good fortune on that end of it.::To the idiots saying it was a poor biological weapon um the net result has been to destroy our society, lock us up, close schools, nuke freedoms, put millions in poverty, cause youth suicides to skyrocket. Destroy the middle class while China came out clean...::Somewhat plausible.....::::That is a patently false and to boot, extremely illogical, statement.::You are simply wrong.::::Exactly::Its the CCP not the Chinese people::::Most people aren't saying it's bioweapon::So people become sick with Covid symtoms which are identical to cold and flu symptoms. So people appear to have what could have just been the flu in November. Ya, thats not normal for sure. And scientists all over work with corona viruses, they also get colds, are they evil?::Only to people like you who do not know where the corona viruses live naturally or how many different ones there are where they come from. You know only about Wuhan and that lab and therefore you connect the only dots you have. In reality the dots are too many to be connected::Fort detrick Maryland::There is a ton of circumstantial evidence that it was a lab escape. GoF research the Wuhan Lab on the very virus that is the closest match to C19, the natural habitat for host is miles away, etc. Seek out the NY Mag article on the subject.::If the goal wasn't mass murder but mass panic to destroy an enemy's economy and remove a leader who was eating their lunch...... Based on fact half the US (and an entire political party) still has their panties in a wad over a virus that is no threat to % says otherwise.::However, it is completely plausible, after SARS-1, that zoonotic sampling was being done, resulting samples studied, and perhaps even GOF research performed to evaluate risks, and an accident happened. A weapon is unlikely but the above scenario is not improbable.::When from a Nobel laureate whose work is in this area of virus research, it's a bit cheeky for a nobody to cry, ""conspiracy theory."" From his expertise he states it is a ""watchmaker's virus"" that could not have occurred in nature.::::American claims of secret weapons of mass destruction programs.::Everyone knows this was the case. Just not politically correct to report in todays U.S. administration and close ties to China by Biden admin and Big Tech companies. Thank you for your courage to report the truth::Its your basic coronavirus but with a few extra components to make it more contagious etc...::You don't. But a weak virus that isn't obviously a weapon...as a test to see how the others respond...?::In production, might mean it wasn't a finished product before it leaked out...?::Of course it was engineered. Event was the planning phase. This is all economic, not about a virus.::Can we not spread C-19 related conspiracies? This is coming from a right leaning media outlet with a mixed reputation for honest reporting.::Maybe co-operative between China and USA interests. Indications: unusual deaths of viral microbiologists for decades - in ; flu vaccine with SARS; whistleblower predicted Ukraine pandemic Nov ; USA vaper+old agers pneumonia-like deaths late ; Fauci funding Wuhan.::Who would develop a bioweapon that you know will spread uncontrollably, will kill mostly the old and infirm, will predictably mutate, and cant be targeted or controlled? What possible purpose or benefit would accrue from deploying it?::Correct. But WIV could, and most plausibly did, hotwire spike proteins to accelerate likely mutations in their vaccinology research.::Exactly! The accidental release of the virus does not mean anyone was working on a biological weapon. That's the conspiracy part. This could happen elsewhere.::Misinformation and clickbait from another country is still not ok.That is what this story is.Check your news sources with or the like and country of origin isnt that important.::Murdoch publication::Its crazy to think that Wuhan had the largest store of novel coronaviruses on the planet, was performing gain of function tests, was located right next to the first confirmed case, AND also had nothing to do with its outbreak. Come on.::Its crazy to think that Wuhan had the largest store of novel coronaviruses on the planet, was performing gain of function tests, was located right next to the first confirmed case, AND also had nothing to do with its outbreak. Come on.::This source is known for spreading non-factual information.::EXPERIMENT! What part of that word is difficult for you. Conduct an experiment to gain experience, I dont know, does that help?::Excellent indeed. This has been going on for a while, in the West also. We dont need to assume weaponization.::Exactly.::There is similar research going on in the West also. We should all learn from this.::I agree. The acdela release of the virus from a Wuhan lab is plausible. However I dont believe they were working on a weapon. That is a stretch.::Xenophobia has nothing to do with it. Actual intelligent people can separate what the Chinese government did or attempted to do to their own people(possibly the Hong Kong protest and it grew way out of hand and spread that way) and the innocent Asians living here in America.::Stupid? Are the goals of CCP to elimate the US, or to reverse the historical roles of power?::I know its difficult for one minded people, maybe this will help: Experiment . To conduct an experiment . To try something new, especially in order to gain experience.::But a bio weapon that essentially shut down all major world economies at the same time Chinas economy was in a trade war and was crippled seemed to work pretty well::This is very interesting! Thanks so much!::Also if Asher's account is true, why did U.S. intelligence agencies come to the opposite conclusion last April?::""confirms?""::Maybe the Chinese government had intended to use it due to the Hong Kong protests but it totally got out of hand and it spread that way.::This is not a fantastic article. It is conjecture by an erotica novelist with multiple debunked statements.::Agree.::""tons!""::This rag is just another Rupert Murdoch owned edition of unscientific hogwash. You are falling for the right wing disinformation campaign peddling xenophobia and fear.::It's *Yunnan, bro. I mean once is a typo, twice is just ignorance.Also, ""it can't happen because it never happened before at pandemic levels"" is one of the most childish fallacies I came across on the topic.Lab accidents DID happen before and will happen again. Read a little.::The bigger the claim, the greater the need for hard evidence. I don't have access to The Australian, but did Mr. Asher provide documents to back his claim...given the evidence is declassified?::Right wing disinformation peddled by Bannon is picked up by Rupert Murdochs Australian rag and stokes the fire of xenophobia - yet again.::Qanon ignores reality, facts and evidence. This story has facts and evidence.::We really need open, honest, transparent discussions about this (sans politicization and xenophobia, which is clearly hard for some). It would be most helpful.::Destroyer of economic security is a pretty good bioweapon to be honest. Loss of jobs, housing, schools in shambles, sports in limbo. Seems like it worked to me.::All discussions seem meaningless, cuz China rejected the early investigations in the first place, cleaned up the lab, &amp; spread the possibilities that it's from the US. So? why not people blame CCP hiding &amp; covering up the fact in early stage, but just let them shift the focus::If anything, antibodies in the Yunnan province support the lab leak theory, since most CoV strains kept in WIV originated from Yunnan caves, miles away.Paradoxically, there was no outbreak in Yunnan, so ""natural"" bat viruses in Yunnan did not have pandemic potential.::What if it wasn't intended to be used on an opponent? You can't assume that everyone on the planet would be repulsed by the concept of eliminating humans that typically cost more than they contribute. There might be a lot of them around.::If ""precedent"" is your only argument, maybe it's time to do some reading on historical lab accidents, notably with SARS-CoV-1 in &amp; and Ebola in Russia. There is currently zero evidence for a ""natural"" zoonotic event. No animal, no place, no first patient.::You asked for a source. I provided a credible academic one, you provided YouTube videos.If you want to be taken seriously enough for anyone to bother examining your source, post a serious source.::It doesn't make sense on many levels. Blood work in hisec biolab would show what's up. The virus itself is not a good choice for a ""bioweapon"". There are more reasons for it being rather an unfounded speculation at best.::Yeah just like you watched the videos and addressed specific issues in them.::Read the paper.::""No credible evidence supporting claims"" - noone said there is credible evidence.Have you even taken the time to watch them? How are they poorly produced? The guy literally takes scientific articles and thoroughly goes through the data addressing inconsitencies.::But it killed our economy::Can you support your findings please! The world thanks you in advance!::You may disagree with her scientific work, but I think it's important for scientists to study all of this. China the country is not known as being most forthcoming to world with scientific info- that's not a ""Qanon"" position to take into consideration.::Actual scientific research, not poorly produced YouTube rants:::A scientist from Austria wrote paper ""The genetic structure of SARSCoV2 does not rule out a laboratory origin."" Scientists from around world should be able to study theories of origin - that's not ""Qanon""And people can distinguish actions of China the county from ""minorities""::CHINA VIRUS was released so China could get control of Hung Kong uprising.::::Mr Arthur - I hope you are being paid well to keep encouraging people to bury their heads in the sand. Fortunately for mankind there is enough intelligence out here to ignore you.::Thats not what the article says.

I read somewhere it could be as high as in compensaion, but I'm not sure.::I am a pro vaccine person (not a pro-vaccer.. that isn't a thing). However, if you want to put your point forward:a) make sure it makes senseb) make sure your presentation is precise and concise (less than hrs).c) don't try to bully people into your point of view.::Dr K thinks it's exosomessimultaneously betraying his lack of knowledge about both infectious diseases AND exosomes::Not true. Both airlines and Ticket Master have made announcements about needing the vaccine before a person can fly or attend a concert. Next it will be grocery stores. There are more interesting ways to look important. This isn't it.::All vaccine reactions are not immediate. The fact that his symptoms of thrombocytopenia took three days is not surprising at all. It takes time for a platelet count to drop low enough to have petechiae. Thrombocytopenia is a well-known adverse reaction to vaccines.::Best Twitter Tweet of the day!::The second someone says that I MUST do something, it is % about me. At least to me it is.::Treating cancer is quite a bit different than treating a virus. We got lucky with this virus having a very good target for attack. Not all viruses have that. Plus, years of tech development isnt abnormal.::Scarlett fever actually still exists. It's advanced strep throat that isn't treated quickly enough. It is easily treated with antibiotics. However, it's ridiculous to think that vax's will eradicate all illness. There are literally thousands of viral and bacterial illnesses.::Yeah I dont think theres reason to make it mandatory at this point for most people. But of all the ways to make a vaccine, this one seems particularly clean and minimal.::Finally, when you get an active infection, your own bodys cells produce the virus RNA. Thats how you get more virus. The only difference with the vaccine, is you only get the RNA for the protein, not the whole virus. So the vaccine RNA risk cant be more than the virus RNA risk::Of note: it can not invade your DNA. One, it cant enter the part of your cells where your DNA is kept. Two, RNA doesnt get converted to DNA in our bodies. It goes DNA to RNA.Also, to the immunity from active infection:::NHS or private, wouldn't you sue the company, not the care provider (assuming the regulatory authority had reasonably met requirements of due diligence)? Eg class actions against breast/ hip implants, primados) My aunt has such a case re a hip replacement has 'shed' inside her::But, you'll be protected by the vax though right?::Yes, people HAVE been asking questions for many years because they did suffer. No one wants to listen. They are bullied and laughed at. Many of them used to laugh too....until it happened to them or their child.::Fine, but the NHS don't get to have their cake, *and* eat it.::I was conscripted into paying subs to the NHS, there is NO contract that obliges me to do, or not do, what the fcuk I like behaviouraly and still get whatever medical treatment I need, and have paid for, so sod off.::They think they're God.::Me too!::My point stands its not a vaccine.::Vaccine-A preparation of a weakened or killed pathogen, such as a bacterium or virus, or of a portion of the pathogen's structure that upon administration stimulates antibody production or cellular immunity against the pathogen but is incapable of causing severe infection.::That is your choice but don't get on a plane with me on board and don't expect to play music on an event I stage nor get anywhere near me or my fellow shielders.::No no &amp; no.::This is not a vaccine...there are so many first do no harm treatments, cheap, effective and available.This Virus isnt even close to some of these.::Bingo::They will not say its compulsary,but if we dont have it we will be denied work,benefits,travel,entry etc etc we will be ostracised by the gov and the ppl that have had it!!Divide and conquer,ppl will police other ppl and shun them,thats what a dictatorship is sadly!!::You think I'm trusting anything on there? You made the definitive comment and I'm asking you to show me, if you can't show me the actual ingredients, don't try sounding like you know something you absolutely don't.::::I've known for quite some time, thank you::This isnt new. Theyve been forcing this upon kids for a very long time. Welcome to the fight.::Never had a vaccination in your life then ?::Lovely. People don't agree with you so you hope they die. Sorry sweetie. I'm in my s and I'm probably going to outlive you WITHOUT a vaccine.::Therein lies the problem. It's rDNA and no-one knows what effects both short or long term that is going to have. Obviously you are far too young to remember what happened with Thalidomide. Hailed as a wonderdrug, it had devastating consequences on unborn children.::Oxford one isnt MRNA is it ?::Not sure why the academics stating ""we have no desire to take a policy position without concrete data"" should alarm me. Maybe our interpretation of this differs!::How? Taking the covid vaccine does not protect anyone from getting the virus or transmitting it.::They'll always be in business short of an immense catastrophe!::Pfizer's still in business despite this (one of many):::Hahaha yes, exactly this!I have a near % organic and somewhat balanced diet and yet some fat greaser thinks I should be denied treatment from the NHS which I've paid into and worked in, along with my family.::Sort of childish::Maybe people should be asking questions. Swine flu vaccine? ""A new narcolepsy epidemic... minimal clinical trials. The manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, was given an indemnity by the UK government...""::Brainwashed get some help::Lockdown and social restrictions can have that effect on people.Very simply - we have never tried this therapy in humans before. Animals don't like it.it is not a vaccine.You need to learn more about how DNA works and what foreign mRNA can do to a body.Best do your own R::Hardly reassuring: ""we have no desire to take a policy position without concrete data"".::Yep, the world has gone mad and watch too much TV. I can't believe how many dumb people there actually is in the world. Propaganda can be powerful stuff. Only need to check the ONS website to see how low the numbers actually are, people panicking for no good reason.::Lies, the virus has been isolated, stop spreading lies::Obviously you have no sense of humor and most likely AS. As you know what it means, I have to say that I am quite fascinated with human interaction and social capabilities, in an abstract way.::They are not really any vaxxers tho, just anti - covid vax. People Take all the others because there is data on them, evidence and folk know what they do. Unlike the current covid one that is being pumped by what looks and sounds like a really corrupt government with an agenda::You call yourself an anus here on twitter. How does that relate to you in everyday life?::What's the story on this? cocktail has high efficacy (far from % though)Ivermectin looking better and betterPossibly other therapeutics because I'm not keeping score::Miami Doctor Israeli man ? ? Norwegian in sSo far. But probably werent vaccine related. More than likely Covid on death cert??::So many things can corrupt DNA, you should know that if you have read any book. By the way, are you so patronizing in your everyday life or just here in Twitter?::taxi::The Nazis took their inspiration from the eugenicists in America. It was all part of the Progressive movement.Fascinating history, especially right now.::Can I suggest you find a decent high school biology text and start there?In a normal cell the DNA is the source of the mRNA.if you introduce foreign mRNA it can get incorporated into the existing DNA, or potentially corrupt it.::But you talk about DNA reprogramming, thats why I asked, not because of mRNA Reprogramming.::Exactly, what's the feckin point...::Patients must be informed so they can agree to a medical intervention.This is not a vaccine. It is gene therapy.::Feel free to google ""is there MRC5 in the Covid vaccine"", but if you can't be bothered...::Ctrl-F and type in mRNA Reprogramming::irrelevant - the Code still doesnt apply::::In the article its not mentioned that the ADN is reprogrammed, can you explain your theory of reprogramming DNA please.::Can we stop f*cking comparing covid to smallpox and polio ffs. It just makes you sound really ridiculous and hysterical.::mRNA is not a vaccine and the approvals have been rushed through with no safety data.::Oh bore off with this nonsense.Only perfect person in existence.::I sent you a link already that discusses reprogramming.::Enjoy going out of business then!::No an international and approved vaccination program is not a medical experiment and doesnt come under the Code. And every recipient has consented.::So, new proteins that might create trouble, however, where is the original DNA reprogramming?::He did. he is not an expert in genetics. he is however an expert in buggy programs.::Have you read yet?No! But you'll all shite from Sikora, and Hen Egan. Like the sheep or lemmings you are.::that's beside the point. The mRNA is a program. The cell will produce proteins and if the wrong proteins are produced the body will have problems. That's the minimum.::It might be, but it needs extensive R&amp, experimentation and trials.Animal trials often produce disturbing results.These therapies were produced in months with minimal testing.::mRNA is the expression of DNA, does not modify it.::I was hoping you had some research experience with search engines.This might help::I wasn't replying to the original post::Gene therapy is the future for many type of cancer and other diseases::Didn't Bill Gates do a little presentation video on this many months ago?Standing with a dna strand model and explaining briefly about the RNA?::All I can tell you is what we know already. Attempts at this technology are known to produce auto-immune responses.They can also make the target more effective rather than less so convid is more likely to kill in this case.mRNA is inserting into DNA to run a program. Bugs bad.::At least thats different now, lets see if it makes any change in narrative. Would disease with % mortality for &lt;70 year olds classify as if hadnt changed definition of pandemic back in ?::hahaha! yep, pretty apt!::Prof. Dolores Cahill - Explains the risk of taking the vaccine::::Who is ""WE"" ? This is an easy solution::Easy solution to that::Enough to know that reprogram in not caused by mARN. So, I am looking forward to hearing your reprogramming theory::::Perhaps it should be noted that we are not talking about an actual vaccine. For that you need to isolate the virus. Intact.this is gene therapy using m-RNA. Not a vaccine at all.::hahaha::Cause they are stupid dont know what is in it and further more wont stop the measures they got planned so whats the fucking point they are that stupid::I don't think we will miss you David in the shops, or on transport, in the pub or in restaurants but your wife will sick of you hanging about the house..::::What do you R&amp Mr Chemist?We need a baseline if we have to teach you immunology and cell biology.::::::::::So you are not against all vaccines, that a good thing.What is the purpose of the reprogramming, turn humans into some kind of new updated humans? How does this work, change one kind of cell that will control the brain or make humans kind of stupid?::::::How many is many and where did you get data from that they did not suffer. How do you know this.::Or mass immunity. But those vaccines use the actual infectious agent in an inactive or attenuated form, so the body knows exactly what to look for.This vaccine is an attempt at reprogramming our DNA to produce what some scientist thinks is an identifying marker.Risky.::::But who is it who's saying these things?::Can you guess why they are practically eradicated? Hint, mass vaccination.Stop mass vaccination against all diseases and in a couple of generations most of your family not vaccinated will die of a XX century disease.::If they are practically eradicated why take a vaccine?::later perhaps, when the war is over.::The thing is, it ISN'T A CURE, it mitigates the symptoms. I've no issue with the vax, have it if you want. I'd prefer to wait a wee bit, just in case. That shouldn't be a problem,should it?::We are Phase of a drug trial - or medical experiment if you will.and if you know your Nuremberg Code you will also know about informed consent. It's No. .::Even if you have the vax no one knows whether it stops you passing Covid on to others as do vacinnes for TB and so forth. So how can we be protecting anyone else if we Have the vaccine.::Passport control now. Very few now and getting fewer.::So vaccinated have more rights than anyone else. Under the English bill of rights we have individual equal rights in a free democracy. What you are talking about is a totalitarian dictatorship. How far we have fallen and so fast.::Seriously people follow this cretin ?::Also NickyPerhaps head over to Alison Wright's TL on Nazis::CharlieMeet Alison AlisonCharlie::And NOT allowing interventionist medicine without informed consentThere will not be informed consent in any meaningful sense of the legal, ethical or medical phrase::NickyDolores Cahill is worth listening to on the mRNA but perhaps during the day::Smallpox, rubeola, etc are illnesses that give lifelong immunity. Efficient vaccines are easier to develop. But a virus that mutates all the time, like flu or covid are very different. There are viruses like HIV, against which there is no vaccine. But there are treatments!::Are you against all vaccines or only anti COVID vaccine?::Highly problematic. No responsible parent should give it to their child, who is at less risk than from the flu. I hope to take one of the traditional attenuated virus vaccines::Read::I went to Walgreens and they are all out of the flu shot.::Nope. you f*kers don't set the terms of freedom and citizenship.::Covid-19 isn't that dangerous to the majority of the population - who don't need to be vaccinated::And you don't think what's happening now isn't an experiment? Anyone taking this V is a guinea pig::My comment was that many people have taken vacines in the past without asking any questions and they did not suffer.::My friends mum works for NHS. She had her vaccine last week. Today she was taken to hospital with suspected pneumonia. She is under . Could it be a possible side effect of the vaccine? I have no idea but she was usually fit and well.::Are you anti all vaccines or only anti COVID vaccines? If you want to die of diseases practically eradicated in the western world last century, then, dont get any vaccines for you and your children.::Thats why they had to make sure no viable therapeutics/preventatives seemed possible early last year.::As incorporated into the glorious New Zealand Bill of Rights (1990)::Oh FFS. You really are a conspiracy theorist aren't you. Read simple description on what the vaccine does. It simple so even you might understand it.::What's the problem if you have had it yourself, mate?::::We need discrimination law passing, to protect people on the basis of their vaccine status ASAP. We must not, as Blair warns, find it impossible to travel or work.::It's a completely different beast to other vaccines. Have you read bit yet?::I've had the virus but somehow the scientific concensus changed in to tell me that I'm still not safe unless I'm vaccinated.::Good that means if it still around, seeing as most of us will have, it you may get it. And let's hope you don't die from your stupidity.::I suggest you read explanation of the rna/dna vaccine he puts it in simple terms that even you pair might understand.::You dont have to have it. Nobody should have to have it. That doesnt preclude you from being called a cunt for not having it though.::And yes I don't believe there is any conspiricy.::This wasn't on the Beeb: , this tweet has been disappeared several times recently.::I suggest you read this tweet from he explains dna/ rna of the vaccine in simple terms.::Do you treat aids victims the same?::Shame on you. Who are you to make such statement?::Just to clue you up....that picture has a trap in it. there's no such thing as LATROGENIC reaction.....its either a TYPO by someone meaning well....or a deliberate trap to get the doctor to say no it won't cause that. ITS ACTUALLY iatrogenic::So should fat people and smokers and drinkers and meat eaters and people who don't exercise enough.::Show me....I've no way of knowing in advance other than nabbing its ingredients list from Pfizer safe somewhere....so show me plz.::::Ideal for those who have lost their jobs or businesses due to draconian methods. What kind of fluffy world do you actually live in?!::And people who blindly line up for the vaccine then get ill should also be denied treatment.::Love this::Good::Exactly! I'm fine if people want it. It's when people harass, coerce, manipulate others into having it is when I take umbrage::I am resigned to the fact I will probably need to opt out of 'new normal society' if Agenda /The Great Reset are implemented.::No problem at all::Pro- vaxers might want to watch this before deciding to say yes ...::::If you have the vaccine, you will be protected... otherwise what's the point of having one/two or however many you'll need?::What's technology got to do with testing a new vaccine? First it is usually tested on animals, then on humans - for many years, not a few weeks or months. You can't test a new vaccine on your Alexa LOL.::I'm not.::I saw that on livestream yesterday. Looks like he's suffocating in there.::I think very quickly you would allows to go places without evidence of vaccination. No concerts, no sports venues, no travel to other countries. The organisers of these events will just stop you. They have that choice::its pretty subjective to where you live and the life expectancy where you are, here in england i think it should be round -80, depending on how fit you are, idfk, tho i wasnt being serious in the other tweet::Lying gets no one anywhere. Name the hospital so this lie can be verified but you won't as its not true. You should be ashamed and no one has said anyone will be forced into having the vaccine. Yet another lie. Please state who said you will be forced.::Just to let you know there's no MRC5 in the vaccine.::Never worked with children in any capacity? Never worked in any sort of medically adjacent field? Never worked in a field that would require a tetanus shot? Never traveled abroad to a country that required a vaccine?::He, and the rest with same fate, will be added to the Covid fatalities count.::HahahahaaaaaI've had over dozen jobs in a variety of fields working with thousands people and NEVER ONCE, has vaccination come up.Yes some places require but not many::Have you never had a job in your life??

Its about choice. We each make an informed decision. I wont have it as Ive researched it and for a virus that, dare I say, is no deadlier than the flu the risk outweighs the benefits::There is a government paper out which says the jab has made it worse! Trying to see where I saw the paper! People in China were cured with intravenous vitamin C::::This vaccine is unsafe ..why should other people risk their lives so you can feel safe???::If you believe in vaccines and get one why would you be afraid? Explain that? If your now immune???::I pay for it so I will use it if I want, but rather they Shut the NHS, I will take responsibility for my own health.I am not living to protect a health serviceAnd if you want to have V thats up to you. I have more respect for my body and will not be injecting toxins into it::::What an idiot. What is it you think this V does ?It is only about making money for drug companies .::Nope do some better research.Polio died out because of improvements in the standards of hygiene and sanitation. Nothing to do with V.Nothing has ever been eradiated by V, all a V does is make billions for drug companies. Which is why they are pushing this one so hard.::They did not, and anyone who claims otherwise is lying.::But if you are ""vaccinated"" there would be no risk for you, so?::Nothing has ever been eradicated by a vaccine, research a little better .::They have indemnified themselves against damages. But one good way to make sure you have no evidence of problems is to give everyone the jab. That way you have nothing to compare it with. Just a thought.::You have a point, however, smokers are only killing themselves, drinkers too, unless they attack people when drunk etc.::Something for the animal lovers...The usual animal trials skipped so we can be the guinea pigs for the as-yet-unfinished phase /3 Pfizer trials - MHRA has the software ready to process the data!::Should nhs workers who refuse vax be refused treatment also?How about smokers? Drinkers? People who eat takeaway?::The vast majority of scientists these days will confirm whatever the person paying them wants them to confirm.A scientist being paid by the Govt ceases to be a scientist::Thats your choice obviously, however if you need nhs treatment for covid you should be refused::You trust bought and paid for government shills. Good foe you. Take your vaccine and it'll kill you with the next common cold you get.::Sincered good luck::I have no issues with people who want it, only with those who coerce, manipulate others into having it::This is outrageous.

Do want all these people to bar you from stuff because of what they ""perceive"" as danger?::But it's not though is it. It's not % that is just fake news put around by people like you.::Why should you have the liberty to spread the disease, infect and possibly kill others?With rights comes responsibility, something which anti vaxxers seem to forget.::Exactly! People nowadays Speak of tolerance but only if it agrees with what they want!::And your points is???::Why should I have the vaccine to try and prevent the spread whilst you want to spread it all over the place?Totally selfish attitude on your part.

Too much speculation on here::It's a shame that you are Still around!::It will be up to the countries being flown into not the airlines::They won't need NHS treatment if they develop covid because young healthy people cannot die from the flu unless they have an underlying condition. Average age of deaths is , same as the normal flu.::Hysterical and hypocritical rubbish, unless you apply the same principle to every communicable disease, unhealthy lifestyle choice, or risky activity.::So by your logic the same should be said for smokers, drinkers, obese people, people who hurt themselves through stupidity (you know, like licking plug sockets), or anyone who hurts themselves or falls sick as a result of a conscious choice.
