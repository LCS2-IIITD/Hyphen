16,16,politifact7888,politifact7888_16,"The secret struggle to balance national security and individual liberty broke out into open this week, after a series of blockbuster revelations, starting in The Guardian newspaper.",true_
17,17,politifact7888,politifact7888_17,"We learned that the government has the capacity to track virtually every American phone call, and to scoop up impossibly vast quantities of data across the Internet.And our first guest is The Guardian columnist getting these scoops, Glenn Greenwald.",true_
21,21,politifact7888,politifact7888_21,"In March 2013, you report the government collected 97 billion pieces of data, almost all of it from outside the U.S. What's the key finding here?GREENWALD: There are two key findings.",true_
22,22,politifact7888,politifact7888_22,"One is that there are members of the Congress who have responsibility for oversight, for checking the people who run this vast secret apparatus of spying to make sure they are not abusing their power.",true_
23,23,politifact7888,politifact7888_23,"These people in Congress have continuously asked for the NSA to provide basic information about how many Americans they are spying on, how many conversations and telephone and chats of -- of Americans they are intercepting, and the NSA continuously tells them, we don't have the capability to tell you that, to even give you a rough estimate.So what these documents that we published show, that were marked top-secret to prevent the American people from learning about them, was that the NSA keeps extremely precise statistics, all the data that the senators amassed where that the NSA has falsely claimed does not exist.",true_
24,24,politifact7888,politifact7888_24,"And the other thing that it does, as you said, is it indicates just how vast and massive the NSA is in terms of sweeping up all forms of communication around the globe, including domestically.STEPHANOPOULOS: You also drew new criticism yesterday from the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper.",true_
25,25,politifact7888,politifact7888_25,"He called the disclosures reckless, said the rush to publish has created significant misimpressions and added that the articles are filled with inaccuracies.",true_
26,26,politifact7888,politifact7888_26,"Your response to that?GREENWALD: Every single time any major media outlet reports on something that the government is hiding, that political officials don't want people to know, such as the fact that they are collecting the phone records of all Americans, regardless of any suspicion of wrongdoing?",true_
27,27,politifact7888,politifact7888_27,The people in power do exactly the same thing.,true_
28,28,politifact7888,politifact7888_28,They attack the media as the messenger and they try and discredit the story.,true_
29,29,politifact7888,politifact7888_29,"This has been going back decades, ever since the Pentagon Papers were released by the New York Times, and political officials said, you are endangering national security.The only thing we've endangered is the reputation of the people in power who are building this massive spying apparatus without any accountability who are trying to hide from the American people what it is that they are doing.",true_
30,30,politifact7888,politifact7888_30,"There is no national security harm from letting people know that they are collecting all phone records, that they are tapping into the Internet, that they are planning massive cyber attacks both foreign and -- and even domestic.",true_

32,32,politifact7888,politifact7888_32,"The only thing being damaged is the credibility of political officials and they way they exercise power in the dark.STEPHANOPOULOS: One of the things you reported is that the government has, quote, ""direct access"" to the servers of massive internet firms, like Google and Microsoft and Facebook, and all the companies have come out and denied it.",true_

37,37,politifact7888,politifact7888_37,What's your understanding about what is actually happening?,true_
38,38,politifact7888,politifact7888_38,"Because it does appear that they don't have direct access to the servers.GREENWALD: Well, our story was very clear.",true_
39,39,politifact7888,politifact7888_39,"What we said was that, and -- and we presented it as the story from the start, was that we have top secret NSA documents that claim that there is a new program called The PRISM Program, in place since 2007 that provides, in the words of the NSA's own documents, direct collection, directly from the servers of these companies.",true_
40,40,politifact7888,politifact7888_40,"We then went to all of those companies named, and they said no, we don't provide direct access to our servers, so there was a conflict, which is what we reported, that the NSA claims that they have direct access, the companies deny it.Clearly, there are all kinds of negotiations taking place and all kinds of agreements that have been reached between these internet companies that store massive amounts of communication data about people around the world, and the government.",true_
41,41,politifact7888,politifact7888_41,We should have this debate out in the open.,true_
42,42,politifact7888,politifact7888_42,"Let these companies that collect massive amounts of information about people, and the government, resolve this discrepancy in public.",true_
43,43,politifact7888,politifact7888_43,"Tell us what it is exactly that these companies are turning over to the government, and what kinds of capabilities the government is wanting to access?",true_
44,44,politifact7888,politifact7888_44,"So we reported these discrepancies precisely because we want them -- those parties to resolve it in -- in public, in sunlight, and-- and let people decide whether or not that's the kind of country they want to live in when -- when the government can -- can get this massive amount of information.STEPHANOPOULOS: The DNI spokesman also said that a crimes report has been filed by the National Security Agency.",true_
45,45,politifact7888,politifact7888_45,Have you been contacted by the FBI or any federal law enforcement official yet?GREENWALD: No.,true_
46,46,politifact7888,politifact7888_46,"And -- and any time they would like to speak to me, I'll be more than happy to speak to them, and I will tell them that there is this thing called the Constitution, and the very First Amendment of which guarantees a free press.",true_
47,47,politifact7888,politifact7888_47,"As an American citizen, I have every right, and even the obligation as a journalist to tell my fellow citizens and -- and our readers what it is that the government is doing, that they don't want people in the United States to know about.",true_
48,48,politifact7888,politifact7888_48,"And I'm happy to talk to them at any time, and the attempt to intimidate journalists and sources with these constant threats of investigation aren't going to work.STEPHANOPOULOS: You described your source as a reader of yours who trusted how you would handle the materials.",true_
49,49,politifact7888,politifact7888_49,"The source has also been described as a career government official, who was concerned about these programs.",true_
50,50,politifact7888,politifact7888_50,A former prosecutor called the source a double-agent.,true_
54,54,politifact7888,politifact7888_54,"Because what they were seeing being done in secret, inside the United States government is so alarming, and so pernicious that they simply want one thing.And that is for the American people, at least to learn about what this massive spying apparatus is, and what the capabilities are, so that we can have an open, honest debate about whether that's the kind of country that we want to live in.",true_
55,55,politifact7888,politifact7888_55,"And if the people decide that they -- yes, they do want the government knowing everything about them, intervening in all of their communications, monitoring them, keeping dossiers on them, then so be it.",true_
56,56,politifact7888,politifact7888_56,But at least we should have that debate openly and democratically.,true_
57,57,politifact7888,politifact7888_57,"Unfortunately, since the government hides virtually everything that they do at the threat of criminal prosecution, the only way for us to learn about them is through these courageous whistle-blowers who deserve our praise and gratitude and not imprisonment and prosecution.STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, should we be expecting more revelations from you?GREENWALD: You should.STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Glenn Greenwald, thanks very much.STEPHANOPOULOS: Now to the senator who says he did everything short of leaking classified information to shine a light on these surveillance programs.",true_
58,58,politifact7888,politifact7888_58,Here is Mark Udall on the Senate floor more than two years ago.,true_

63,63,politifact7888,politifact7888_63,"Is everything we're learning this week consistent with what you knew then?UDALL: It is, George, and as you pointed out, I tried to draw attention to what was happening over two years ago.",true_
65,65,politifact7888,politifact7888_65,"Because the president has come out and said that that the programs are approved by Congress, overseen by the courts, and carefully constrained.",true_
66,66,politifact7888,politifact7888_66,Here he was on Friday.,true_
67,67,politifact7888,politifact7888_67,"(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: They are very focused, and in the abstract, you can complain about big brother and how this is a potential program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.",true_
69,69,politifact7888,politifact7888_69,"My main concern is Americans don't know the extent to which they are being surveilled, George.",true_
70,70,politifact7888,politifact7888_70,"We hear this term metadata, which has to do with when you make calls, where you make calls to, who you're talking to.",true_
71,71,politifact7888,politifact7888_71,"I think that's private information, and I think if the government is gathering that, the American people ought to know it, we ought to have a discussion about it, and frankly, I think we ought to reopen the Patriot Act and put some limits on the amount of data that the National Security Administration is collecting.STEPHANOPOULOS: What kind of limits exactly?",true_
72,72,politifact7888,politifact7888_72,"Because as the president pointed out, no one is listening to phone calls here, and they are not allowed to continue the targeting of any individual unless they have probable cause, unless they have developed some information that would give them a reason to continue with tracking.UDALL: My concern is, look, you know through a contract with your company that they're going to collect this data, but the phone company can't arrest you, prosecute you, put you in jail.",true_
73,73,politifact7888,politifact7888_73,"And metadata, although it sounds simple and it sounds innocuous, can lead to a lot of additional information.",true_
75,75,politifact7888,politifact7888_75,"We do need to remember, we're in a war against terrorists, and terrorism remains a real threat, but I also think we have to cue to the Bill of Rights, and the Fourth Amendment, which prevents unlawful searches and seizures, ought to be important to us.",true_
76,76,politifact7888,politifact7888_76,"It ought to remain sacred, and there's got to be a balance here.",true_

79,79,politifact7888,politifact7888_79,"I don't think the American public knows the extent or knew the extent to which they were being surveilled and their data was being collected.STEPHANOPOULOS: But Senator, the president has said that this has been fully debated and authorized by the Congress.UDALL: It has been, George, but in a limited way, if I might make that point, and that's why I want to reopen the Patriot Act, I think now that this information is more available.",true_
81,81,politifact7888,politifact7888_81,"That's my point, is let's have a debate here, let's look at what is really happening.",true_
82,82,politifact7888,politifact7888_82,It's what I was trying to draw attention to two years ago.,true_
83,83,politifact7888,politifact7888_83,"Millions of records every day being accumulated, makes me uneasy.",true_
85,85,politifact7888,politifact7888_85,"Let's take a further look at this.STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think that the administration has been straight with the Congress in their testimonies?UDALL: You know, in general, I do.",true_
86,86,politifact7888,politifact7888_86,"And look, this is the law, but the way the law is being interpreted has really concerned me.",true_
87,87,politifact7888,politifact7888_87,The law has been interpreted in a secret way.,true_
88,88,politifact7888,politifact7888_88,"That's what I've been calling for, is let's have full disclosure of how this law is being applied.",true_
89,89,politifact7888,politifact7888_89,"This isn't a scandal, but this is deeply concerning to me and a lot of Americans, and frankly a lot of my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle.STEPHANOPOULOS: And do you believe, though, that the program has been effective?",true_
90,90,politifact7888,politifact7888_90,"We had Chairman Mike Rogers coming up saying, who said that this program has helped stop terrorist attacks, and (inaudible) reported that the subway, the attempted subway plot in New York subways in 2009 could have been stopped by this program.UDALL: George, I am not convinced, and by the way, there are two programs that are being discussed.",true_
91,91,politifact7888,politifact7888_91,"There is one the so-called PRISM program, Article 702 in the law, and it's been very effective.",true_
92,92,politifact7888,politifact7888_92,"It surveils foreigners, grabs content, photographs, emails.",true_
93,93,politifact7888,politifact7888_93,"The 215 provisions which are collecting all the metadata, I am not convinced that it's uniquely valuable intelligence that we could not have generated in other ways.",true_
94,94,politifact7888,politifact7888_94,"So I know these claims are being made, but that's all the more reason to have a debate, to share this information and to determine whether or not we ought to be collecting millions of records every day of Americans' phone calls.",true_
95,95,politifact7888,politifact7888_95,"It's just to me a violation of our privacy, particularly if it's done in ways that we don't know about.STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Udall, thanks for your time this morning.UDALL: Hey, George, thanks for having me on.STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get a response now from the chairs of the intelligence committees, Democrat Dianne Feinstein from the Senate and Republican Mike Rogers from the House.",true_
99,99,politifact7888,politifact7888_99,"Your response.FEINSTEIN: Well, of course, balance is a difficult thing to actually identify what it is, but I can tell you this: These programs are within the law.",true_

101,101,politifact7888,politifact7888_101,"It should be noted that the document that was released that was under seal, which reauthorized the program for another 90 days, came along with a second document that placed and discussed the strictures on the program.",true_
102,102,politifact7888,politifact7888_102,That document was not released.So here's what happens with that program.,true_
103,103,politifact7888,politifact7888_103,The program is essentially walled off within the NSA.,true_
104,104,politifact7888,politifact7888_104,There are limited numbers of people who have access to it.,true_
105,105,politifact7888,politifact7888_105,"The only thing taken, as has been correctly expressed, is not content of a conversation, but the information that is generally on your telephone bill, which has been held not to be private personal property by the Supreme Court.If there is strong suspicion that a terrorist outside of the country is trying to reach someone on the inside of the country, those numbers then can be obtained.",true_

108,108,politifact7888,politifact7888_108,"One of them is the case of David Headley, who went to Mumbai, to the Taj hotel, and scoped it out for the terrorist attack.The second is Najibullah Zazi, who lived in Colorado, who made the decision that he was going to blow up a New York subway, who went to a beauty wholesale supply place, bought enough hydrogen peroxide to make bombs, was surveilled by the FBI for six months, traveled to go to New York, to meet with a number of other people who were going to carry out this attack with him, and were arrested by the FBI, who has pled guilty and in federal prison.Here is the point.",true_

117,117,politifact7888,politifact7888_117,Because he says that that hasn't helped.,true_
118,118,politifact7888,politifact7888_118,"That is his suspicion, at least.ROGERS: Well, I can tell you, in the Zazi case in New York, it's exactly the program that was used.",true_

120,120,politifact7888,politifact7888_120,They are not -- the National Security Agency does not listen to Americans' phone calls and it is not reading Americans' emails.,true_

125,125,politifact7888,politifact7888_125,"What this is, and the reason this happened is after 9/11, we realized there was a big hole in our ability to fully identify all of the players in that terrorist plot.",true_
