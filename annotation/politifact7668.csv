12,12,politifact7668,politifact7668_12,"We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.Expanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with “A” ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans.",true_

30,30,politifact7668,politifact7668_30,"They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.By now, it’s well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun.",true_

34,34,politifact7668,politifact7668_34,But it’s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.A majority of senators voted “yes” to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks.,true_
35,35,politifact7668,politifact7668_35,"But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.I’m going to speak plainly and honestly about what’s happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen.",true_
36,36,politifact7668,politifact7668_36,"We had a Democrat and a Republican -– both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with “A” grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks.",true_
37,37,politifact7668,politifact7668_37,And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that.,true_
38,38,politifact7668,politifact7668_38,"That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.As they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights.",true_

40,40,politifact7668,politifact7668_40,"So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.Their legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence.",true_

42,42,politifact7668,politifact7668_42,She is a Westerner and a moderate.,true_

44,44,politifact7668,politifact7668_44,The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks.,true_
45,45,politifact7668,politifact7668_45,"So while this compromise didn’t contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress.",true_
46,46,politifact7668,politifact7668_46,It represented moderation and common sense.,true_
47,47,politifact7668,politifact7668_47,"That’s why 90 percent of the American people supported it.But instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill.",true_
48,48,politifact7668,politifact7668_48,"They claimed that it would create some sort of “big brother” gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite.",true_

51,51,politifact7668,politifact7668_51,"But that didn’t matter.And unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators.",true_
52,52,politifact7668,politifact7668_52,"And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and they’re all good people.",true_
53,53,politifact7668,politifact7668_53,I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown.,true_
54,54,politifact7668,politifact7668_54,And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun.,true_
55,55,politifact7668,politifact7668_55,"And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.But the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn’t want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun.",true_
56,56,politifact7668,politifact7668_56,There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn’t do this.,true_
57,57,politifact7668,politifact7668_57,It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections.,true_
58,58,politifact7668,politifact7668_58,"They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too.",true_
59,59,politifact7668,politifact7668_59,"And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote “no.”One common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldn’t prevent all future massacres.",true_
60,60,politifact7668,politifact7668_60,And that’s true.,true_
61,61,politifact7668,politifact7668_61,"As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil.",true_
62,62,politifact7668,politifact7668_62,We learned that tragically just two days ago.,true_
63,63,politifact7668,politifact7668_63,"But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.And this legislation met that test.",true_
64,64,politifact7668,politifact7668_64,And too many senators failed theirs.I've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory.,true_
65,65,politifact7668,politifact7668_65,"And my question is, a victory for who?",true_
66,66,politifact7668,politifact7668_66,A victory for what?,true_
67,67,politifact7668,politifact7668_67,All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check.,true_
68,68,politifact7668,politifact7668_68,That didn’t make our kids safer.,true_
69,69,politifact7668,politifact7668_69,"Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done?",true_
70,70,politifact7668,politifact7668_70,"It begs the question, who are we here to represent?I've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced.",true_

72,72,politifact7668,politifact7668_72,"“Emotional blackmail,” some outlet said.",true_
73,73,politifact7668,politifact7668_73,Are they serious?,true_
74,74,politifact7668,politifact7668_74,Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don’t have a right to weigh in on this issue?,true_
75,75,politifact7668,politifact7668_75,"Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?So all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.But this effort is not over.",true_
76,76,politifact7668,politifact7668_76,"I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don’t give up on it.",true_
