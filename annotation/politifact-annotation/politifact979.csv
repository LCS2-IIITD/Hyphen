15,15,politifact979,politifact979_15,"And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces.Many people in the United States -- and many in partner countries that have sacrificed so much -- have a simple question: What is our purpose in Afghanistan?",true_

49,49,politifact979,politifact979_49,And we will insist that action be taken -- one way or another -- when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets.The government's ability to destroy these safe havens is tied to its own strength and security.,true_

57,57,politifact979,politifact979_57,"I'm also calling on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Maria Cantwell, Chris Van Hollen and Peter Hoekstra that creates opportunity zones in the border regions to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued with violence.",true_

66,66,politifact979,politifact979_66,"Together, we must enhance intelligence sharing and military cooperation along the border, while addressing issues of common concern like trade, energy, and economic development.This is just one part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent Afghanistan from becoming the al Qaeda safe haven that it was before 9/11.",true_
67,67,politifact979,politifact979_67,"To succeed, we and our friends and allies must reverse the Taliban's gains, and promote a more capable and accountable Afghan government.Our troops have fought bravely against a ruthless enemy.",true_

74,74,politifact979,politifact979_74,"This push will also help provide security in advance of the important presidential elections in Afghanistan in August.At the same time, we will shift the emphasis of our mission to training and increasing the size of Afghan security forces, so that they can eventually take the lead in securing their country.",true_
75,75,politifact979,politifact979_75,"That's how we will prepare Afghans to take responsibility for their security, and how we will ultimately be able to bring our own troops home.For three years, our commanders have been clear about the resources they need for training.",true_
76,76,politifact979,politifact979_76,And those resources have been denied because of the war in Iraq.,true_

83,83,politifact979,politifact979_83,"Afghanistan has an elected government, but it is undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people.",true_
84,84,politifact979,politifact979_84,The economy is undercut by a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency.,true_
85,85,politifact979,politifact979_85,The people of Afghanistan seek the promise of a better future.,true_
86,86,politifact979,politifact979_86,"Yet once again, we've seen the hope of a new day darkened by violence and uncertainty.So to advance security, opportunity and justice -- not just in Kabul, but from the bottom up in the provinces -- we need agricultural specialists and educators, engineers and lawyers.",true_
87,87,politifact979,politifact979_87,That's how we can help the Afghan government serve its people and develop an economy that isn't dominated by illicit drugs.,true_
88,88,politifact979,politifact979_88,And that's why I'm ordering a substantial increase in our civilians on the ground.,true_
89,89,politifact979,politifact979_89,"That's also why we must seek civilian support from our partners and allies, from the United Nations and international aid organizations -- an effort that Secretary Clinton will carry forward next week in The Hague.At a time of economic crisis, it's tempting to believe that we can shortchange this civilian effort.",true_
90,90,politifact979,politifact979_90,But make no mistake: Our efforts will fail in Afghanistan and Pakistan if we don't invest in their future.,true_
91,91,politifact979,politifact979_91,And that's why my budget includes indispensable investments in our State Department and foreign assistance programs.,true_
92,92,politifact979,politifact979_92,These investments relieve the burden on our troops.,true_
93,93,politifact979,politifact979_93,They contribute directly to security.,true_
94,94,politifact979,politifact979_94,They make the American people safer.,true_
95,95,politifact979,politifact979_95,"And they save us an enormous amount of money in the long run -- because it's far cheaper to train a policeman to secure his or her own village than to help a farmer seed a crop -- or to help a farmer seed a crop than it is to send our troops to fight tour after tour of duty with no transition to Afghan responsibility.As we provide these resources, the days of unaccountable spending, no-bid contracts, and wasteful reconstruction must end.",true_
96,96,politifact979,politifact979_96,"So my budget will increase funding for a strong Inspector General at both the State Department and USAID, and include robust funding for the special inspector generals for Afghan Reconstruction.And I want to be clear: We cannot turn a blind eye to the corruption that causes Afghans to lose faith in their own leaders.",true_
97,97,politifact979,politifact979_97,"Instead, we will seek a new compact with the Afghan government that cracks down on corrupt behavior, and sets clear benchmarks, clear metrics for international assistance so that it is used to provide for the needs of the Afghan people.In a country with extreme poverty that's been at war for decades, there will also be no peace without reconciliation among former enemies.",true_
98,98,politifact979,politifact979_98,"Now, I have no illusion that this will be easy.",true_
99,99,politifact979,politifact979_99,"In Iraq, we had success in reaching out to former adversaries to isolate and target al Qaeda in Iraq.",true_
100,100,politifact979,politifact979_100,"We must pursue a similar process in Afghanistan, while understanding that it is a very different country.There is an uncompromising core of the Taliban.",true_

104,104,politifact979,politifact979_104,"And that's why we will work with local leaders, the Afghan government, and international partners to have a reconciliation process in every province.",true_
105,105,politifact979,politifact979_105,"As their ranks dwindle, an enemy that has nothing to offer the Afghan people but terror and repression must be further isolated.",true_
106,106,politifact979,politifact979_106,"And we will continue to support the basic human rights of all Afghans -- including women and girls.Going forward, we will not blindly stay the course.",true_
107,107,politifact979,politifact979_107,"Instead, we will set clear metrics to measure progress and hold ourselves accountable.",true_

110,110,politifact979,politifact979_110,And we will review whether we are using the right tools and tactics to make progress towards accomplishing our goals.None of the steps that I've outlined will be easy; none should be taken by America alone.,true_
111,111,politifact979,politifact979_111,The world cannot afford the price that will come due if Afghanistan slides back into chaos or al Qaeda operates unchecked.,true_
112,112,politifact979,politifact979_112,"We have a shared responsibility to act -- not because we seek to project power for its own sake, but because our own peace and security depends on it.",true_
113,113,politifact979,politifact979_113,And what’s at stake at this time is not just our own security -- it's the very idea that free nations can come together on behalf of our common security.,true_
114,114,politifact979,politifact979_114,"That was the founding cause of NATO six decades ago, and that must be our common purpose today.My administration is committed to strengthening international organizations and collective action, and that will be my message next week in Europe.",true_
115,115,politifact979,politifact979_115,"As America does more, we will ask others to join us in doing their part.",true_
116,116,politifact979,politifact979_116,"From our partners and NATO allies, we will seek not simply troops, but rather clearly defined capabilities: supporting the Afghan elections, training Afghan security forces, a greater civilian commitment to the Afghan people.",true_
117,117,politifact979,politifact979_117,"For the United Nations, we seek greater progress for its mandate to coordinate international action and assistance, and to strengthen Afghan institutions.And finally, together with the United Nations, we will forge a new Contact Group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that brings together all who should have a stake in the security of the region -- our NATO allies and other partners, but also the Central Asian states, the Gulf nations and Iran; Russia, India and China.",true_
